https://atailoredsuit.com/about-tailored-suit.html,"The idea for A Tailored Suit started in December of 2004 when one of the company’s founders, Antonio, needed a suit for an interview.
Traveling throughout East Europe, he was unable to locate a suitable fitting off-the-rack jacket and was forced to adjust his travel plans to New York so that he had a few days to shop for a suit before the appointed time.
Antonio was introduced to the art of custom clothing in New York in which he gained a strong passion for.
It was clear to see right off the bat how superior a tailored garment was compared to the off-the rack options available.
On the flight home to the U.S. Antonio pondered how difficult and confusing the art of custom clothing can be for men. Especially men who are not educated in men’s style.
He wanted to change that.
Fast forward three years: Antonio has consistently worked with menswear stores as a consultant while obtaining an ever increasing knowledge in the realm of custom clothing and high-end fashion for men.
Why do this you ask? Antonio’s aim and vision was to build a unified, educational site to help men make smart choices when in the market for custom clothing and high-end fashion.
In the fall of 2007 ATailoredSuit.com was born, with the mission of the company being simple:
Provide men the tools to educate themselves and build the clothing that best complements their individual style. 

From this mission was built the foundation of this website, and upon this idea we draw our strength to provide you with the most in-depth information on men’s custom clothing out there.
Our goal is to help you become the man you know yourself to be."
https://atailoredsuit.com/faq-tailored-suit.html,"Why Should Men Purchase Custom Clothing?
There are three main reasons:
1) Perfect Fit – To wear a bespoke suit is to indulge oneself in the knowledge that the cloth draping over your body was cut for your individual shape. Your suit will only fit one man in the world perfectly. And that man is you. There is nothing else quite like it.
2) Customization – Do you want peak lapels on a 2 button single breasted jacket? Would you like a double vented jacket to ensure your backside is not exposed when you place your hands in your pockets? How about your name or a special message inscribed above an interior pocket? These are just a few of the thousands of options available if you decide to go custom.
3) Quality – A good tailor using superior fabrics will create quality that cannot be match compared to what you can find in a standard menswear store.
For more information on why to choose bespoke, visit our style guide article on the subject
Off-the Rack Clothing is So Much Cheaper! Does Custom Clothing Justify the Cost?
Yes, off-the-rack clothing is cheaper……but do you want a cheap suit that does not fit your body, is the wrong color for your complexion, and is not built to last a single professional cleaning?
Custom bespoke suits complement your unique features, which make you look and feel great. When wearing something of quality, not only will you save costs over time as the garment will last you longer, you will also enjoy wearing your clothing, which will really bring down the cost per use.
I need to get measured.. where do I start?
Along with many informative articles in high-end men’s fashion and custom clothing, A Tailored Suit provides detailed instructions on how to take your own measurements. 
Can I really measure myself accurately?
Yes, no doubt about it. By following the detailed instructions in our measurement guide and using a fabric tape measure, you can consistently obtain accurate measurements. As an alternative, you can always go to your local tailor for measurement taking if you feel more comfortable with that approach.
I love this site but I am Men’s Style Newbie. Where do I start?
Great to hear! There are two sections of A tailored Suit that would provide you with timeless information on custom clothing and high-end menswear:
1) Style Guide  – Our guide has many articles for you to get a firm grasp on mens style. Probably the most complete list of topics you can find anywhere on the subject!
2) Our Articles section – A list of categories in which you can drill down to the areas you are interested in.
Please explicitly define your interpretation of Bespoke.
Bespoke is where something is made from the primary parts for a single customer.  This means creating a pattern for every single customer based off their measurements alone, then using this pattern to build garments unique in the entire world from the fabric and to the design specs as determined by the customer.  Bespoke requires a human touch; machines can be used, but only as tool guided by a skilled artist.  The final bespoken creation is perfect for only one man, the man who commissioned it.
All These Articles Are Great and I Want to Learn More! Where Can I Get More Information on Men’s Style?
While we will be providing many more articles in the future, we also offer a 47 page ebook on the 7 deadly sins of men’s style which I recommend checking out.
In addition to this, our resources section provide further reading and tools to further your knowledge of high-end fashion and custom clothing."
https://atailoredsuit.com/three-necktie-selection-tips.html,"When dressing in suit and tie, it is the necktie that will often add the dash of flavor to the overall outfit.
While suits are typically gray, navy, or black and dress shirts either blue or white, it is a man’s neckwear that adds a strong accent with its color and pattern.
With so many necktie options, finding the perfect tie that matches can be overwhelming. This article seeks to alleviate that pain.
When a man matches a tie to a dress shirt and suit the three most important factors to weigh are 
1) Necktie Pattern
2) Necktie Color 
3) Necktie Proportion
Ties come in many patterns ranging from stripes to paisleys to tartan-check.
So how would you go about matching a patterned tie to a pin-striped suit and a checkered pattern dress shirt?  What are the rules to matching necktie patterns?
The rule for matching patterns is that no two pieces of clothing should utilize the same pattern size and to a lesser degree pattern type.
By pattern size I mean the distance between the stripes on your shirt should not be close to the width of the stripes on your tie; by doing this you can create an optical illusion of movement which the human eye finds unattractive.
Hence matching a subtle pin-striped suit with a larger check patterned dress shirt and intricate paisley pattern tie is acceptable;
However wearing that same pin-striped suit and large check patterned dress shirt with striped tie that too closely mimics the suit’s stripe separation will create a questionable look.
This rule applies when matching 3 or 5 patterns and of all three factors is the most important; a man will not wear a tie whose color he doesn’t like, but will often try to wear one whose color is pleasing but pattern is wrong.
Please note that for the purposes of tie matching we do not classify solid colored ties as having any pattern. Therefore the rules of pattern matching do not apply to true solid colored neckwear.  As a result you could match multiple solids…..the combination would be boring, but acceptable.  However, because pattern is not a factor the next two variables are even more important when considering a solid necktie.
When matching color the first thing you should do is look at all garments together to make sure that the colors are in harmony; if you have doubts trust your first impressions and try something different.
“Convincing yourself” something matches may enable you to wear it, but you’ll not wear the combination with confidence.  Trust first impressions – others you meet will.
But what does it mean to match, and what has precedent in terms of priority?
Most of us can see when there is a conflict between colors – something just looks wrong.
If you feel your tie does not match, do not try to force it; instead simply substitute it for a more subtle necktie.
If uncertain, the safest bet is to stick with the traditional (but somewhat boring) tie colors of business.  Non-bright red and to a lesser extent gold and blue will go with most dark suits and  white or light to medium-blue shirt combinations.
Finally always remember that you want the necktie to accent your suit and shirt, not dominate them.  If your tie overpowers your suit, you can bet it will draw attention from your face as well.
Although often not as important as either pattern or color, proportion can play a role in matching when a necktie varies from the standard 3.5 inch width and is either a skinny tie (less than 3 inches wide) or excessively wide tie (more than 3.75 inches). 
For skinny or wide ties you need to take in factors such as the height and weight of the individual and the width of his suit’s lapels.  A thin petite man will look sharp with thin lapels and a thin tie, while a large man with wider build lapels wearing the same skinny tie will look ridiculous."
https://atailoredsuit.com/5-worst-grooming-mistakes-men-make.html,"Grooming…seems simple, right?
But imagine you were:
Do I have your attention?
Anyway…
Whether or not you’ve faced those situations (or even similar ones)…
We all need self-awareness.
Think of your grooming practices:
And while you’re at it, check out these 5 grooming mistakes men make – which you’ll want to avoid from here on out.

What if you had no form of schedule or timetable at work? And you were assigned task after task on any given day…
Deadlines would clash. Stress would build up. And you’d end up doing everything less efficiently.
That’s why you need a routine for a lot of things – including your grooming. The goal behind it is to be proactive, not reactive.
You want to be able to plan out when you’re going to shave, cut your fingernails, have a haircut and your nose/ears/neck hair trimmed.
Without the initiative to plan ahead, bad habits start to creep in. Without a weekly grooming schedule, and a daily skincare routine, you tend to procrastinate till the very last minute.
Some worst-case grooming scenarios you wouldn’t want to face:
So as basic as it is to have a grooming routine, remember that not having one can lead to some major consequences – making your life more difficult than it has to be.
Let’s all agree on this: an ounce of prevention = a pound of cure.
As true as that statement is, how many of us apply it to everyday life? How many of us regularly take measures to maintain our health and appearance?
If you see some of those guys who are 10, 20 or 30 years ahead of you, notice how they always “look the part” and kick butt at whatever it is they do. People admire them and seek their advice.
They’re the ones with the wisdom and life experience. They focused on more prevention and less cure. By using skin lotions and creams properly, they managed to avoid cracked hands or other common skin problems. And because of that – they can show off a fresh, youthful face for plenty more years.
There’s one concept that’s widespread in society these days – “instant gratification.”
As in getting stuff NOW. Reaping the rewards now. No journey or baby steps. But that just isn’t the nature of proper grooming.
Being healthy and well-groomed takes time. That includes switching products in the hopes of better results. It doesn’t happen overnight.
If a new anti-dandruff shampoo doesn’t seem right after the first day, try it for a bit longer to make sure.
It’s the same deal if you change to a shaving lotion after using an alcohol-based product. You may have to wait a few weeks before any big improvement kicks in.
It’s about patience and commitment. Even for the other end of the spectrum: growing a beard. You might be halfway through the process of growing a specific beard style – and your face starts to itch.
If you really want that beard, do NOT shave. It’ll make all your progress go to waste. Find a way to deal with the itching. Isn’t the final result worth the discomfort?
We’ve been told this since childhood: everything in moderation.
And that applies to most of our daily grooming practices. Especially when we use fragrances.
How many of us go beyond 1-2 sprays of cologne every time? Some think it’s completely okay. Some just want to smell “extra” better.
But those guys forget about the fact that what smells right to them might be too strong to others (given that they use that amount frequently).
That’s why men should educate themselves on various fragrances such as cologne and perfume – plus the different terminologies and concentrations for each.
It’s not just so you can avoid “coming off strong” when you enter a room. It’s also about finding the perfect scent/product to complement your body chemistry.
Aside from fragrances, you should avoid overdoing the following:
Being a family man, a devoted husband or a hard-working professional…
…should NOT involve martyrdom.
You might be at a stage in life where others mostly depend on you. But your well-being doesn’t have to take the back seat. You’re still your own provider. You’re still in charge of your body.
There’s really no excuse for neglecting yourself. Forget the “superman” or “tough guy” image. Abusing your body only gives you bogus bragging rights. Eventually, you’ll be looked down upon.
The most impressive AND attractive men are the ones who can strike a balance. They handle their responsibilities for other people while still keeping themselves healthy and well-groomed.
They know that without caring for themselves – they can’t take care of anyone else. That’s the mindset you need in your everyday life."
https://atailoredsuit.com/10-distractions-that-decrease-productivity-and-how-to-fix-them.html,"It seems one of the most popular excuses of the 21st century is “I don’t have time”.
The reality is, gentlemen, there’s plenty of time, but most of it goes to waste on distractions.
Your time is limited each day, most people would absolutely love more of it.
So why waste it on unimportant things?
Today I’m listing 10 distractions that pulverize your productivity and I’ll give you some simple tips on how to fix them, so you can increase your productivity.
Without wasting any more time (pun intended)…
Mobile phones have slowly integrated into our daily lives.
While they are essential for communication, they also play a huge part in most peoples workdays.
But phones put a ton of stress on our productivity, simply due to the number of distractions they carry.
Calling and texting is one thing, but it gets even worse with social media.
These kinds of apps can be addicting because they feed our tendency to socialize and keep up with people.
These apps are a major source of distractions, and they know it! They will constantly remind you of various things at all hours of the day.
These distractions can include ring tones, notifications and even LED indicators that blink in bright colors.
All of this can be overwhelming, and when you add to the fact that most of it is not important, the problem becomes obvious.
Here are some tips on how you can deal with this:
“Time Wasters” can be summarized as things – and sometimes people – that require a lot of attention, but provide little or no return.
These are things that – no matter how annoying – simply aren’t high on the priority matrix.
The priority matrix is an effective and simple way to break down the importance of tasks.
So the next time you know you have a bunch of stuff to do, try organizing it all with this simple method – and you’ll increase productivity on all of them.
Simply put, getting what’s important done first releases the pressure. This leaves you with a good overall idea of how much time you can spend on other things.
Nicotine and caffeine are part of many people’s daily lives.
The average smoker in America takes in 15 cigarettes a day.
Combine the time it takes to smoke one cigarette and the time it takes to find a smoking area, and you’ll find that hours of your day will be spent on this habit alone.
While it’s hard to flat out ask you to just stop smoking, I strongly suggest doing a breathing exercise instead.
This will help you to battle the desire to smoke and help you to focus on getting your work done, and thus increase productivity.
Coffee shops are a multi-billion dollar business. Over 50% of Americans report they drink it every day.
Women report they consume coffee as a relaxing, socializing opportunity. Men mostly drink coffee as preparation for work.
For lots of men, coffee becomes an addiction, and without your morning coffee, you feel like you can’t get much work done.
To battle needlessly drinking coffee, drink as much water as you can. Being thirsty is the main drive that leads us to drink any beverage.
Not only will this help you overcome your addiction, but by balancing out how much coffee you drink, you will be able to push through the need to drink coffee and be more productive.
There’s no doubt the U.S. has a problem with obesity – there are many factors in that equation, but sugar plays a major role.
Many people complete a meal with a dose of sugar, that’s why desert exists. What most of them don’t know is how much sugar is in the snacks they eat.
Snacking can be a distraction in itself because you’re not focused – your hand is jumping around from the task to snacks.
You also risk spilling something and making a mess, and the noise you create can annoy you and your coworkers.
This is why most offices have a “no eating at the work station” rule, to reduce distractions and increase productivity.
To minimize the need for sugar and snacks, make sure to eat regularly and drink plenty of water.
Along with coffee and cigarettes, these addictions are not only time consuming, but also distracting as they can cause unease until the craving is fed, lowering your productivity.
A huge cause of daily distraction is spending a lot of time overthinking.
It’s one thing to put too much focus on a first date, but what I’m talking about is the practice of fact-checking things, even when we’re sure of something.
The internet has given us unlimited resources on demand, but it also created a culture of searching for everything and anything.
This creates doubt in people and forces them to search for things, just to confirm what they already know.
While being absolutely sure of something isn’t a bad thing, fact-checking everything does not mean you will be more productive.
But even this is just part of the problem. The average person – searching for an answer to a question – will open multiple sources only to read the same thing, written in a different way.
Also, searching for one simple answer can often lead to lots of pointless web browsing.
The amount of ads and suggested links popping up doesn’t help us here either.
So, if you need to search for something, find a credible source that will become your go-to, instead of using search engines. This will help you to narrow your focus, and reduce the time you spend on useless browsing.
There are countless arguments on both the positives and negatives of playing games, but there’s no doubt they can become addicting.
Question is, do you play video games in your spare time, or do you neglect other things to play the game?
A study by Brigham Young University suggests playing games can boost creativity, improve decisions making and increase productivity in office life.
However, the real culprits of this addiction are small, mobile-friendly video games. Those that offer no results other than virtual achievements and short term satisfaction.
Most of them are packed with addicting features that give you the incentive to play them on a frequent basis.
These are masked as rewards for playing at a specific time or for a certain amount of hours and so on.
They send notifications such as “You haven’t played for X amount of days” or “X person has earned a certain achievement”.
In the best-case scenario, they are just annoying. But in the worst cases, they force you to spend countless amounts of time and money.
The best thing you can do is to avoid these altogether and find a different source of entertainment, which brings me to my next point.
Reading the news is a very popular way of passing time. You’ll notice a lot of people are doing it.
An unmeasurable amount of time each day is spent on reading news that has no benefit or just isn’t factual.
Unfortunately, most news sources are interested in clicks more than the quality of their content – that’s why they rely on “clickbait”.
By using shock factors they make users think “I’ve got to see this”. What often follows is a story that’s either overdramatized or underwhelming.
The media knows dramatic stories attract a lot of attention. That’s why a big portion of the top news stories are negative.
Now I’m not saying that you should cut yourself off from the world, reading news is a good way to keep up to date.
It’s just that you’ve got to be careful which news sources you trust.
The best idea is to pick the one you will follow, instead of relying on browsing. Alternatively, you can pay someone to scour headlines for you and send you daily updates with the most important stories.
This will help you to focus your attention only on the things that matter, and keep you from losing track of your time.
It’s hard to tell which meetings are important, and which waste everybody’s time.
Attending meetings that hold no value to you can be as bad as doing nothing.
While you may find many coworkers enjoying them and treating them as “extended breaks”, they’re wasting your time in the long run.
Which would you rather do:
Assuming you have things to do and deadlines to stick to, the meeting may either be postponed or skipped altogether.
So bring it up to your manager, they will appreciate your honesty and initiative, but make sure you’re explaining why you think the meeting is not helpful – otherwise you risk consequences for trying to get out of work.
You know that inner alter ego talking to you, with whom you have conversations long into the night?
No, that’s not what I’m talking about, do you think I’m crazy?
Who knows, but what I am talking about are the voices of self-doubt.
These thoughts go through our heads more than we like to admit.
The way to eliminate them is stopping for a second to rethink.
This should not take more than a couple of minutes but will help to refresh your energy and regain focus.
What follows is that rush of energy and boost of confidence that will make you crush any obstacle.
Feeling hungry is the most natural daily distraction everyone faces. This is something you can’t automate or ignore.
Most people have a tendency to eat only when they feel hungry, and often at specific times.
But that feeling is often just the beginning. What follows is feeling tired due to a lack of energy.
You get anxious to get things done – or go eat – and thinking about which to do first saps your energy even more.
So you either speed through a task, leave it and lose momentum, or compensate by snacking.
To beat this distraction, plan out a daily eating routine. That way your body can get used to when and how much you eat and adjust accordingly.
Regardless of how many meals you eat per day, what matters is consistency, and consistency will help you to be more productive.
Let’s quickly remind ourselves of what we talked about:
With all this in mind, you’re all the more ready make the most out of your day.

https://atailoredsuit.com/morning-style-hacks.html,"Good morning!
Wait… are your mornings even good ones? Tell me honestly…
For many men, the typical morning is spent skipping his breakfast, triple-checking his phone and then putting his clothes on frantically.
These men feel pressed for time …the whole time. Can you relate to this?
If only there was a way to make your mornings longer, to give yourself some more breathing room in between tasks and chores.
You’re in luck, gents. I’ve written this article to give you 10 time-saving morning style hacks that enable you to do just that.
Let’s start with a simple one. We all know how challenging it can be tie your tie in the morning. You’ve gotten out of bed groggy, pressed for time, and anything that requires some focus and attention to detail is best done beforehand.
It’s an amazing feeling when you discover – even in the most hectic of mornings – that your necktie has already been pre-tied with the appropriate tie knot. And all you have to do is pass the loop through your neck and tighten it up.
Trust me when I say it’s quite a lifesaver to get your tie done the night before. In fact, have it squeezed into your normal routine before you hit the sack. Set aside time each night to ensure everything’s set for the following day wardrobe-wise. That means following this next hack…
Don’t you hate wasting precious time in your mornings just to pick out stuff and put them on, only to realize:
A. Your suit has a button that’s loose?B. Your shirt still has that coffee stain from last week?C. The whole thing doesn’t match?
That’s why it’s extremely useful to have tomorrow’s clothes laid out and checked on before going to bed. With a fairly relaxed state of mind, you’ll figure out which sports jacket, which belt, and which pair of shoes best go together. You’ll spot any red flags in your clothing and find the right alternatives. Come the following morning, all that’s left is the wearing part.
One item that’s quite handy for this is a clothes valet (also known as a valet stand). This free-standing piece of furniture has features such as jacket/trouser hangers, tray organizers, shoe bars, and some also include a jewelry box. If you buy one, the process of laying out and preparing your outfit becomes much smoother. Use the closet to store and sort out all your stuff. But let the valet stand serve as your day-to-day wardrobe assistant.
Bonus Tip: Have A Set Uniform
Wouldn’t your days be far more hassle-free if you always get out of bed and wear what’s right? The thing is you can make that happen, even if you don’t have a specific uniform for work. Understand the level of formality that’s expected of people in your office.
Based on that, work within those boundaries. Build yourself an interchangeable wardrobe in which almost every clothing item can be matched with one another. The goal here is to “automate” the dressing-up part of your morning. The less thinking you need, the better.
Similar to #1. Shaving demands patience and accuracy, especially with traditional types of razors like straight or safety razors. And the majority of us would concentrate better while using them at night.
You can delay the exact moment to fall asleep, but you can’t disregard the time you arrive at the office. So again, figure out how to logically fit shaving in your evening routine. Perhaps it can come right after you brush.
I get it. Sometimes you’re exhausted from all the hustle and bustle of a hard day’s work. So once you’re home, you end up leaving your valuables in random locations. But here’s the problem: you might forget where you last saw those items next morning. Each and every one of them.
Great – who’d want to start their day with missing car keys or a misplaced wallet? Don’t allow yourself to become a victim. Learn the habit of placing all your valuables (wallet, keys, sunglasses, watch, etc.) in one appropriate “home.” Options include valet trays, trinkets, and certain kinds of jewelry boxes if you’ve got multiple watches. The key here is you do NOT put anything else. Keep the area exclusive to essential non-clothing items to prevent any losses.
Do you really think I’d advise you to sleep while fully dressed in your suit or office attire? No! That may technically save you some time, but it’s not worth seeing all the folds and wrinkles that formed overnight.
Instead – go to bed in your gym gear so the minute you wake up, you’re a bit more eager to exercise. That doesn’t just mean you get to skip one round of switching clothes. There’s a real psychological benefit to it.
By seeing yourself dressed in the proper gear, you are more inclined to tell yourself: “I might as well go for a run or work out.” That kind of motivation doesn’t exist if you’re in pajamas. Why? Because changing – though it’s not a strenuous task – is something that’s easy to feel lazy about.
Not comfortable sleeping in gym clothes? At least have them ready at the foot of your bed every night. Try it and you’ll soon notice the difference it makes.
Depending on the season, you may like to bathe in the morning with a considerably low or high temperature. But try not to push it to either extreme, more so if it’s a cold shower.
The problem with super cold water is it can somewhat constrict your blood vessels. And when that happens, they lose their ability to function as best as they can. The different roles they have such as circulation, carrying nutrients, and removing waste from your skin can be compromised.
To help them stay active, use mostly lukewarm water while showering. You’re recommended to always start with lukewarm so as not to shock your body. Then you can lower the temperature towards the end.
You can save anywhere between 2 and 5 minutes by following this tip. But why would you follow it? Aren’t we supposed to shampoo our hair thoroughly every day? Think again.
If you do a little research and hear what stylists or hair experts have to say, you’ll find out it’s NOT ideal to shampoo on a daily basis (particularly if the shampoo has high levels of detergents and sulfates). It can cause your hair to become brittler and drier over time. Try to limit shampooing to once every 2-3 days or less often.
Instead, use a good conditioner whenever you shower without being in a rush. Conditioners maintain the hairs, replacing the natural oils that have just been washed off. So yes – your hair needs some greasiness to stay healthy. Not all of us feel comfortable with it, but it’s mainly a matter of getting used to.
This one is self-explanatory. A clear example of killing two birds with one stone.
Have your body soaped nicely. When it’s time to wash, turn on the shower go brush your teeth. Turn your back towards it and let gravity do its job. By the time you’re done brushing, you should be ready to face forward and rinse off the rest of yourself.
This is probably among the most challenging hacks in this list. Can you spend your mornings completely detached from your phone, your laptop, and the TV? Can you go as far as turning them off? I dare you to.
But don’t get me wrong. I understand if you’ve got a job that requires checking emails or messages first thing in the morning. It’s fine. What’s NOT okay is spending 30 minutes for it, or doing it multiple times while you’re getting ready. That’s where you cross the line between being aware of stuff and being “sucked” into stuff.
Why is that an issue? Because you have the rest of the day to pore over your messages. You can catch up on the news during your lunch break. You can enjoy TV in the evening. But you’re not turning the morning into a productive one if you let those things distract you.
I’ve actually made it a habit to leave my phone outside the bedroom. I wake up using a normal alarm clock, and my first order of business is to meet my wife downstairs for coffee. We value those minutes – with the kids still asleep – when we both can sit down and talk without interruptions. I don’t want to go through my mornings with a work-oriented mindset. And hopefully, you also try not to. Start the day making time for your loved ones.
As cliché as it might sound, breakfast is your most important meal of the day.
Don’t believe it? Remember that your mind operates through your brain. And the brain is an organ that needs to be refueled, just like the rest of the body. If your body doesn’t get its fuel, there’s nothing to power-up your brain for the workday that lies ahead.

How often have women simply not given you the time of day? 
Why don’t they ever give you can call back or follow on a second date? 
There are things women instantly notice about men that have absolutely nothing to do with your personality, and it could be playing a bigger role than you think.
What are they, exactly? That’s the topic of today’s article. We’re going into those first impressions that make or break your attractiveness.

When it comes to things women notice, being socially accepted is a key factor. The reason I’ve listed it as number one is that I need to stress it as much as possible. You might be good-looking, you might dress well, you might have the best fragrance in the room… but do you have friends?
Say you walk into a bar with a group of your “bros.” You’re all having a good time. The conversation’s in full swing and they’re clearly enjoying your company. Believe it or not, people notice this – women, especially. They’ll look over and quickly deduce that you’re someone who is socially accepted – someone who is not a creep or a loner. Want to amplify this? 
Go out with your female friends. You don’t need to hit on them, just take them out for an honest good time the way you would with your friends. Heck, do so with your sister.
When WOMEN approve of you, that only lends more weight to your social cred. We are creatures of association, after all – and when the ladies notice that members of their own gender are taking a shine to you, then it instantly makes you more interesting. If you take anything from this article, let it be this!
It’s an unfortunate fact that we can’t change our bodies right away. If we want to improve, we need to commit ourselves to a disciplined exercise regimen. However, even though you don’t have a Hollywood bod, there are still things you can do you negate the issue. And yes, you muscle heads should listen up too – you’re not exempt!
Remember the Style Pyramid? This is all about fit.
You need to strategically build up the parts of your body with clothing as your weapon. 
A well-fitted sports jacket with a solid taper going down the torso will accentuate the shoulders and make you look more masculine. 
A pocket square along with some classic peak lapels will build up the chest. 
Are you looking for more of a street style? Fear not, there’s plenty you can do. Find yourself a leather jacket with texture on the shoulders. You can do this with a sports shirt as well, by seeking pockets and epaulets in order to draw eyes to all the best parts of you.
Gents, I’ve touched on this before. Body language is one of those factors we’re often not aware of, but we need to be. How often do you cross your arms, keep a stern look, or put your hands in your pockets? This is called closed body language, and it’s a no-no. 
Instead, make a habit of doing the opposite. Face the person, open up those arms! We don’t need to go through the extremes – you don’t need to flail and scream, but it’s a good rule of thumb to make yourself look as accessible as possible. 
Always keep that in mind, and you’ll be that much closer to impressing the ladies.
The way you move around has a bigger impact than you think. This is a simple topic to address, so we’ll fly through it quickly. 
If you stand against a wall and the back of your head doesn’t touch the wall, then you have Forward Head Posture (FHP). It’s common in a lot of guys, and there are a few exercises you can do to fix it.
Now, what about the way you walk? Do you slouch? Do you look down as you walk? You’re killing your chances, and when it comes to things women notice, this shows weakness. 
Instead, you want to straighten your back and look forward at all times. You also want to sway your shoulders a bit from side to side. It sounds strange, but research actually shows that women find this VERY attractive on a man.
Yes, I’ve spoken at length about a signature scent and it’s importance, but I feel as though overemphasis might lead some of you to… take it too far. Too much fragrance can be just as bad as smelling terrible. Well, not AS bad… but you get the idea. Any overpowering odor is liable to turn someone off and send them running for the hills.
Do yourself a favor and keep it moderate. Two, no more than three squirts should suffice.
Colors aren’t just something to slap on because it looks cool. Like anything else, it’s a tool at your disposal – use it wisely. There are whole studies devoted to how color benefits men. 
If you want to capitalize on things women notice first, then learn to manipulate contrast. 
Men with high contrast (dark hair, light skin) should opt for similarly bold colors that stand out from each other. 
Medium and low-contrast gents should go for clothing with more subdued colors in them. 
You may not realize it, but it makes your overall look much more cohesive.
The right pair of dress shoes can either make or break an outfit. If used effectively, they can also blend in or be the standout piece. So, how do you get started? Well, since we’re talking about things women notice rather than looking the part at a business meeting, we’re going to focus more so on the casual shoes.
If you want to step up the badass factor, then I recommend dress boots. Even here, there are hundreds – if not thousands – of options to choose from. You can’t go wrong with a pair of sleek, dark brown Chelsea boots though. heck, you can even get away with wearing them in more casual suits. It doesn’t end there, though! I have plenty of articles that go more in-depth when it comes to dress shoes and dress boots.
I love timepieces, they’re addictive. Why have I stressed men’s watches as such a crucial part of the overall look? It’s because watches are about as timeless as style can get. When you consider the fact that they’ve been around since the 1500s, you know men love them for a reason. A stylish watch (and they come in tons of styles) convey a potent message of power, authority, and trust. A man can be dressed casually, but if he’s sporting a quality watch, then there’s little doubt that he’s conscious of himself and his aesthetic.
I won’t pretend like I can do them justice in an article, much less a single section. What I can tell you that if a quartz watch might make a worthy entry to gentlemen simply dipping their toe in the water, so to speak. After that, you can graduate toward a mechanical movement.
Yes, it sounds cheesy – we’re told to smile for just about everything. It’s often as if people expect a smile to solve all their problems. Well, I got news for you. If you want to attract the eye of a worthy woman, then mastering the art of the smile is the way to go. A man with a killer outfit and a seductive smile is bound to catch someone in a conversation!
The key here is not to go into Joker-mode and look like a psychopath. Instead, experts recommend something called “smising.” it essentially means smiling with your eyes. When you do this correctly, you’ll feel the cheek muscles pushing up toward the eyes, hence the name. Keep this in mind, and you’ll knock them out every time.
If you’re looking to keep a woman’s attention, it’s only fair that you look like she’s keeping yours. This means to look her directly in the eyes when she’s speaking to you. Not only does this let her know she has your undivided attention, it creates a subtle and acceptable intimacy that will go a long way.
“Antonio, I’m short – I can’t do anything about it.” Yes, I hear you. It sucks, but studies show that taller men generally make a stronger first impression with the ladies. However, you’re in luck! The same studies show that the effect dissipates over time, leaving the other qualities for stronger consideration.
But what can you do about it RIGHT NOW? As always, style is your weapon. First, you need to make sure your clothes fit you well (a basic rule for everything). Next, you need to place emphasis on your upper body. This means focusing your accessory placement toward the upper body – we’re talking watches, bracelets, pocket squares, and tie pins. Finally, wear monochromatic colors and vertical patterns that help to keep the body looking streamlined.
At the end of the day, women are just like us. They’re on the lookout for potential mates as much as we are, even if we like to think their methods differ. With these easy tips, you have the knowledge you need to get them to your table no matter what! Remember that as always, practice makes perfect. Get out there, gentlemen!"
https://atailoredsuit.com/mistakes-killing-mens-confidence.html,"Let me make this crystal clear…
Women dig a confident man!
That’s not just me spouting off – that’s science talking.
David Klow, a Chicago-based Psychotherapist and owner of Skylight Counseling Center states that “women like direct and confident men the same way a salsa dancer likes a good lead.”
I’d argue that there’s an even more primal reason why women find the confident man way more attractive than his vacillating counterpart. In a nutshell, he offers her a much better chance for survival. Yeah, it sounds pretty caveman-ish, I know, but who am I to argue with biological evolution?
A perfect example: Charles Bronson was certainly no Brad Pitt in the looks department, but the women of his era were tripping over themselves to get at him. Why? Because the gruff confidence he exuded superseded his looks and yielded a brand of strength and power (and sexiness) they just couldn’t resist.
Let’s face it – confidence can be the great equalizer when it comes to attracting women.
But confidence isn’t just exclusive to a man’s carnal conquests. A self-assured man is also comfortable in his true self and knows he has worth. Because of his confidence, people believe in him. It helps him connect well with others, offers him a greater chance at success and gives him an overall feeling of happiness and contentment.
So, with the ripped biceps of psychological characteristics being so important to our mental balance and well-being, why do so many of us (whether consciously or subconsciously) sabotage it so often? Why do we self-subvert (and contribute to the destruction of) this intangible attribute that makes us so awesome?
Here are 8 mistakes you’re making that are crushing your confidence.

Let go of that need for praise and acknowledgment from others! After all, validation is (according to Dr. Karen Hall) nothing more than recognition and acceptance through the prism of someone else’s experiences.
Sure, even the most independent men need a little validation in some aspects of their lives, getting feedback and encouragement from others feels good, but the problem arises when their opinions of you, their approval, trumps your own opinions about yourself – one’s constructed through the prism of your experiences.
This could potentially lead to a constant need for an externality you can’t control…and that ain’t good for the old self-confidence, my friend.
Ever wonder why a gainfully employed man is always more hopeful and positive than his jobless counterpart?
It’s because the man with the job has a particular skill, and that skill gives him value.
Every day he trades that skill to his company, his community, and society as a whole and in return receives the things that give his life meaning: financial security for himself and the warm fuzziness in knowing he’s a provider for his family and a positive contributor to the world in general.
The man who doesn’t know these things in his life is a man whose self-esteem will surely suffer.
There are so many things in life out of your control, but your general health isn’t one of them. Sure, we are all predisposed with certain genetic malfunctions whose strings we can’t pull, but most of the bad health stuff that happens to us is caused by the decisions and actions of that guy staring back at you in the mirror.
According to urologist Dr. Dan Williams, mild and moderate erectile dysfunction affects approximately 10 percent of men per decade of life (i.e., 50 percent of men in their 50s, 60 percent of men in their 60s).
Since obesity, smoking and excessive alcohol consumption are three of the biggest contributors to this certain confidence killer – you only have that limp guy in the mirror to blame.
The selfless concern for the well-being of others can be a very positive (and powerful) force in a man’s life.
Living life under virtues like service and benevolence makes him feel principled and decent, both attributes that bolster his confidence and self-awareness in the world.
Conversely, being a self-absorbed a-hole produces the opposite effect – go figure! The selfish man doesn’t know that warm, right-out-of-the-oven chocolate chip cookie feeling that serving others bestows. That feeling gives him purpose and balance and allows him to hold his head high.
Instead, a jaded heart beats inside the selfish man’s chest, and it pumps through him the blood of arrogance – not confidence.
Walking away is hard. Being alone is a scary proposition for many men, but it’s better than the alternative of sticking around in a poisonous union.
Constant browbeating from a toxic partner prevents personal growth because it makes the person on the receiving end feel small and insignificant – in some severe cases, emasculated and weak.
If you look up antonyms of confident, you will definitely find words like these. So, accept that you can do better then muster up the fortitude and courage to make that split so you can get back that mojo you’ll need to get out there and try again.
Woe is me! How many of us have felt that at one time or another? I’m guessing every single one of us.
We all unconsciously shape who we are by the thoughts we produce, and because some of those thoughts impose boundaries we set for ourselves, many of us have very inconsequential limits in life and achieve very inconsequential results.
The byproduct of all this is, you guessed it, self-pity. And the byproduct of wallowing in self-pity is the complete destruction of confidence.
So, practice some positive thought control and break that confidence killing chain at the first link.
For every yin there’s a yang, and for every angel that sits on a man’s shoulder, there’s a good chance that his pitch-forked nemesis is sitting on the other.
Sometimes listening to that inner voice can be a good thing. A productive thing. It tells us to call an Uber when we’re drunk. It convinces us that those 10-1 odds are probably a sucker’s bet.
It is a rational voice that looks out for us and keeps us safe. However, sometimes there’s the other voice, and this voice has nefarious intentions.
Sometimes he reminds us of our past failures. He dangles our insecurities in front of us, persuading us to act out on our dark thoughts. He is a dark force that will destroy our egos and our confidence if we allow him – so don’t allow him.
Why is it that we’re prone to forgive others much easier (and quicker) than we forgive ourselves? Carrying around that weight of self-imposed guilt from not letting go is like a lead cannonball around our necks. It’s a cancer that eats away at all our future possibilities. Because when we don’t forgive ourselves, we are letting the past control our present and our future.
And maybe it’s just me, but I haven’t seen too many confident, self-assured men driving around in their nice cars with the trunks loaded full of emotional baggage.
So… why not turn these mistakes around and get your confidence back, gents? As long as it never devolves into arrogance or smugness, don’t ever let the self-assurance you get from appreciating your own abilities and qualities be dragged through the mud or disparaged by anyone."
https://atailoredsuit.com/suspenders-how-to-wear-braces.html,"It’s rare to see a well-dressed man without a belt these days.
However, the leather belt as a practical garment is a fairly recent invention.
Prior to the First World War, belts were largely decorative outside of military uniforms (and even then were often more decorative than practical among officers and aristocrats).
The traditional device for holding up a man’s trousers was a pair of suspenders.
To this day, suspenders remain the preferred method to hold up a pair of trousers by many fine dressers.
Suspenders (which are called braces in the United Kingdom, where suspender refers to a garter belt) are straps of cloth that go over a man’s shoulder and down to the front of his trousers, where they either clip or button to the waistband.
Most suspenders join in the back in either an X-shape or a Y-shape, to keep pairs from being separated, but they can be bought as two individual straps as well.
Construction can vary depending on brand, with suspenders being made in materials ranging from pure silk to synthetic rayon; woolen boxcloth is a traditional and durable staple.
Suspenders tend to be elasticized, either at the ends or all the way around the strap. They usually end in a leather flap which affixes to buttons within the trouser waistband, or in clips which grip the top of the waistband.
A belt cinches a waistband tighter to the body; suspenders on the other hand give either three (Y-shaped) or four (X-shaped or separate) fixed points for the trousers to hang from.
Well-fitted suspenders essentially provide a waist-shaped hanger that the trousers rest on.
This eliminates the bunching of fabric that occurs when anything but a very tightly-fitted waistband is cinched with a belt, and allows the fabric around the hips and knees to fall in a smooth plane rather than ballooning out from under the belt.
The neat appearance of trousers held up by suspenders is also widely recognized as a more comfortable arrangement for most men.
The suspenders can be adjusted to raise or lower the pants so that the point where the legs join is comfortably situated.
Trousers can also be worn higher with braces, allowing larger men in particular to drape their trousers down from their narrower natural waist rather than having to belt them uncomfortably beneath their stomach.
In cramped quarters, suspenders can add comfort simply by eliminating a band of leather or cloth that will be pressed against the wearer’s waist, though the buckles or buttons will still be felt.
Suspenders are extremely useful in any outfit where neat arrangement is essential: since the trousers will hang straight down from wherever the waistband is affixed, the pleats or crease of the trouser can be precisely aligned with a vertical element on the upper half of the body.
Suspenders also help keep the front button and fly of the trousers in place, making it easier to align the shirt buttons with the fly and keep the plumb-line straight.
Most men will fasten their suspenders in the back, put their trousers on, and then fasten the suspenders in the front.
Some designs use a metal or plastic attachment that grips or pinches the fabric of the trousers, while others have small buttons at each end of the suspender.
The latter are ideal in that they do not compress and eventually damage the trouser fabric, but they can only be worn with trousers that feature button-flaps for suspenders (situated to either side of the central button and fly, usually on the inside of the waistband).
Trousers that do not feature button-flaps for suspenders will need clamp-style suspenders.
They will also almost always feature belt-loops.It is important to keep in mind that, while there is nothing improper about wearing suspenders and trousers with belt-loops, it is always a faux pas to wear both suspenders and a belt.
In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries it was actually considered improper for suspenders to be visible at all (they were considered underwear), but standards have moved on, and you may now show your suspenders without fear.
Black suspenders are popular because of their flexible neutrality.
Other colors and even patterned suspenders are widely available, though the latter can become a novelty adornment rather than a functional detail if taken to an extreme.
Punk and skinhead cultures have both made a great deal of suspenders, attaching significance to color, pattern, and how the suspenders are worn, so men are cautioned against wearing anything too outlandish — there is a real risk of giving the very wrong impression.
Suspenders are also a requisite part of black tie outfits; there is no such thing as a formal belt. They tend to be black or white, and are not meant to be seen beneath the jacket.
Quality formal suspenders end in braided silk ends rather than leather tabs. Tabs are, however, perfectly acceptable — but clips are not.
While they are usually the more comfortable method of supporting trousers, suspenders are not always as sturdy or as useful as a belt. The main reasons for this are:
Overall we recommend suspenders for most men, so long as they are well-fitted to hold the trousers in place and at the natural waist, without too much sag in the crotch.
Either option remains accepted by fashion and likely will for many years to come, making it ultimately a matter of personal taste.

Both suspenders and belts hold your trousers up. No need to use them simultaneously. It is important to keep in mind that, while there is nothing improper about wearing suspenders and trousers with belt-loops, it is always a faux pas to wear both suspenders and a belt.
To this day, suspenders remain the preferred method to hold up a pair of trousers by many fine dressers.
Suspenders (which are called braces in the United Kingdom, where suspender refers to a garter belt) are straps of cloth that go over a man’s shoulder and down to the front of his trousers, where they either clip or button to the waistband.

Introduction to the Solid Black Men’s Jacket and TrouserA Man’s Black Suit and FormalityConstruction of the Black SuitFitting a Black Wool SuitMatching a Black Men’s Suit with ColorsThe Debate – Should Men buy a Black Suit?Conclusion:  Importance of Owning a Black Suit
Let’s take a closer look at all the elements of a man’s black suit guide and answer the question whether every man should own it!
The black wool suit is an imposing piece of menswear:  somber, formal, and dignified.  Its austere severity makes it an intimidating purchase, but an invaluable addition to the right man’s wardrobe.
Many men keep a black suit as their “wedding and funeral” suit, always appropriate for any serious occasion.
Handling the stark color requires more attention to detail than other styles, but the striking effect of a black suit worn well is more than worth the extra effort.
An un-patterned black suit is the most formal piece of business wear available to a man.  Anything more formal moves into the realm of the black-tie dress code, with a tuxedo replacing the suit.
Patterning will reduce the formality of the suit somewhat, though it’s rare to see black wool with anything beyond a very modest striping. A patterned black suit will usually still serve as a formal business dress, appropriate for anything but somber occasions such as funerals.
Plain black suits are almost always made from wool.  The visual weight of unbroken black is too overpowering to pair with a light, billowing fabric or a high-sheen textile.
Even wool suits may seem too slickly smooth if the wool is very fine, giving the wearer a slightly artificial appearance.
Small amounts of synthetic fibers can add strength and durability to a wool suit, but more than a minor addition to the blend will give black a faintly reflective quality that looks garish in most lighting.
Black suits are often made from the undyed wool of black sheep.  Woven thickly, it gives a very clean drape that helps with the imposing effect of the dominant color.
Black garments are naturally eye-catching, making a good fit extremely important.  A badly-fitted black suit draws the viewer’s attention to its unattractiveness.  Larger men want to avoid looking looming and overstuffed in black, while smaller men need to be cautious of seeming overpowered by their clothing.
The fall of a black suit coat from the shoulder to the hip is particularly important:  to flatter the wearer, a black jacket should always taper gently at the waist, keeping the man from looking like a solid wall.   The suit should never be tight enough to pinch or wrinkle when it moves, nor loose enough to fold or billow on its own.
Since a black suit is already inherently formal, it makes an excellent color for a vested or a double-breasted suit.  Either option will usually be executed in patterned black rather than sheer; the visual effect of monochrome black wool over the entire front of the body tends to be too overpowering.
The added elegance of a three-piece or double-breasted suit more than compensates for the informality of patterning, keeping the suit appropriate for all business-dress occasions.  Upward-sweeping peak-style lapels on the jacket is another excellent option that adds a bit of motion to the visual impression, keeping it lively despite the “weight” of the color.
At their most formal, black suits are worn with plain white shirts and a black tie.
In practical terms the full formality is rarely called for — a man might want to observe it at a funeral, or when the suit is being worn in place of a tuxedo at a “black tie optional” event, but otherwise the options for dress shirts and ties have some flexibility to them.
Patterns with a white base keep the formality high while breaking up the stark visual impression, making them common in shirts for business wear; un-patterned shirts in brighter colors contrast with the black to make a vibrant look suitable for evening entertainment and social events.
Black in large quantities can be overwhelming on men with pale complexions, particularly “low contrast” men who have lighter skin and lighter hair and eye colors.
A fair-skinned man with dark hair can manage the contrast of a light shirt and black suit without difficulty, but a blonde with the same skin is going to appear somewhat washed-out, particularly under any kind of fluorescent lighting (which has an unfortunate tendency to turn lighter colors slightly purple or greenish).
Low-contrast men will look best if they pair black with dark solids, or simply opt for an extremely deep charcoal instead.
Black pairs equally well with gold or silver metallics, but will look gaudy with both at the same time.  Be sure that the watch, belt buckle, tie clip, and any other metal adornments match when wearing black.
Men with glasses should keep the tint of their frames in mind; most eyeglasses will register as either golden or silvery enough to be a mismatch with the other color.
There is quite a bit of discussion as to whether or not a black suit is a smart color choice for a man’s suit.
The arguments are that black should be reserved for formalwear and is not a traditional suit color, that black is difficult to match, limits accessories, and that black is too stark of a color to work with most men’s features.  Some of these are solid points – others, less so.
As you can guess, my stance is that a black suit has a place in a man’s wardrobe; however as previously pointed out it is not the best suit color for men whose complexion and needs call for lighter shades.
A tan skinned, dark-haired man can pull of the contrast a black suit and white shirt combination requires;  his red-headed and pale completed friend, on the other hand, is going to look better in clothing that doesn’t compete with his face for attention.
As for the other arguments – not traditional and hard to accessorize – I answer times have changed and if you can’t accessorize than you lack imagination and haven’t put enough thought into it.  The fact is the black suit is one of the three most popular fabric choices for men looking to purchase their first suit – to simply sign it off as poor judgment ignores the reality that men freely choose this option.  Thus men everywhere have spoken with their actions.
Because of its intense visual impression and the occasional challenges of matching it, a black suit is not the best choice for a man who needs one suit for rare special occasions.  A charcoal gray or a navy blue offers more versatility for nearly the same level of formality.
That said, black makes an excellent suit for anyone who expects to regularly attend serious or formal events, or who simply needs a little extra visual weight and authority in his wardrobe.  If you already have a suit in your wardrobe and it’s looking like a second would be a worthwhile investment, a black suit may be your next step."
https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-suit-colors.html,"The first thing anyone notices about a man’s suit – before the cut, the number of buttons, the proportions – is the color.
First impressions are incredibly powerful, and so it becomes obvious that the color of ones suit isn’t a decision to make lightly.
It need not, however be a daunting task; like much of the rest of classic style, suit color is governed by a few simple rules that, once learned, make color selection an easy task.
The first bit of information to learn is that when it comes to suits, all colors are not equal.
There are certain colors that are appropriate for any occasion, and others that while suitable for one occasion would be completely out of place at another.
Also important to know is that some colors are limited by season, while others have particular associations that, if unknown, could produce unexpected results for the uninformed wearer.
The single suit – that is, a suit for someone who rarely has cause to wear it, and thus has just the one suit.
This is often a “wedding and funeral” garment, as it will only be worn to an event where a suit is mandatory.
In such a case, the suit needs to be as broadly appropriate as possible, so that the wearer will not be out of place at whatever event causes him to don it.
A dark, conservative suit is what you want; black, navy blue or charcoal gray are all equally acceptable. However, if you have to choose one, lean towards charcoal gray as it is perhaps the most versatile.
With that resolved, we can begin to discuss the range of colors available to those who have the occasion to wear suits regularly.
While designer fads tend to shift quickly, causing the suit and its wearer to appear dated and out-of-touch, a traditional suit remains elegant and stylish, its useful life tracked in years or decades, rather than weeks and months.
This is especially important in very formal professions such as politics, finance, and law, but applies more generally to any profession where a conservative, traditional appearance is desirable.
The traditional colors for men’s business suits are black, navy, and gray.
Every wardrobe should be built off a selection of dark suits, as that they are appropriate in almost any circumstance.
Which colors depends on the preference of the wearer, but the vast majority of men would do well to own one of each of the foundation colors – Charcoal Gray, Black, and Navy Blue.
Charcoal gray is a great color for the young man; unlike navy blue it does not accentuate his youth.
It is extremely versatile, and has the unique ability to be paired with either black or brown elements depending on the shade of gray.
A black suit makes itself useful due to its similarity to formal wear, as well as its habit of projecting a sense of authority.
Finally, navy blue suits are excellent choices because of their sheer commonality; you can rest assured in a room of men in suits more than half will be wearing this color.
In addition, it is a very traditional and elegant color, and should be added to the above at the first opportunity. Any of these shades can be had in a pinstripe, though the presence of a pattern somewhat downplays this fabric’s formality. Not to worry, it’s perfectly acceptable for all business occasions.
Brown is another popular base color for suit fabric, with options ranging from tan through to deep chocolate hues.
Many men look their best in earth-tones, making the brown suit an important part of their wardrobe; it is also a popular color for casual options including tweed suits and sports jackets.
One caveat: until the early 1980s, brown was not considered a color for business.
While the times have changed, making brown just as appropriate for business as black, navy, or gray, there are still some members of the old guard who continue to hold to the old rule.
This shouldn’t dissuade the well-dressed gentleman from wearing brown with confidence, but it is important to be aware.
Business aside, there are a wealth of colors available to the well-dressed gentlemen.
Brown tweed evokes the cold, rainy moors of the English countryside, while ivory-hued linen speaks of the steamy tropics. Stripes, checks, and other patterns are such varied options that they merit their own discussion.
Within all the variations, the deciding factor on which particular choice to make is one’s individual coloring, a combination of hair and eye color as well as skin tone.
Many fail to realize that an ensemble that flatters a person of one coloration most likely will not flatter differently-complected individuals; it is important to pay attention to what is emphasized and what is camouflaged by the colors of one’s clothes.
While the most accurate way to match attire with one’s coloration is through trial-and-error, there are general guidelines to point in the right direction.
One important note about trying various combinations in front of the mirror: pay attention to the lighting.
Fabric color appears different under florescent lighting than in natural daylight, so it is important to be aware of how clothes are affected and make selections based on the lighting in which the ensemble will be worn.
The traditional men’s suit colors of black, gray, and navy remain viable options for all but the most high-contrast complexions, as most of the decisions related to complexion surround shirts, ties, and accessories, rather than suits.
For this reason most gentlemen will have little to fear as long as the chosen suit is in one of the traditional colors.
Very high-contrast individuals, however, including those with very dark hair matched with fair skin, and in particular African-American skin tones, require a bit more care, as the wrong color suit can dampen the wearer’s features or even make them seem to disappear outright.
The fair-complected, dark-haired gentlemen will do well to favor dark, rich suits which frame his light features between the dark jacket and hair; light colored suits, including pale grays and tans, will serve to diminish his features.
African-American men may fare better in dark or light suits, depending on their particular skin tone; a dark suit with a light colored shirt provides excellent contrast for the very dark-toned gentleman, while a more muted shirt and tie with a dark suit helps to give the more medium-toned wearer a warm look.
Finally, the light-toned man may be best served by light colored suits in earth-tones, which will harmonize more readily with his lower-contrast complexion.
With a mastery of color firmly within ones grasp, it is now time to move on to the next set, the more advanced options discussed in The Suit: Exploring Patterns."

The Men’s Navy Blazer – In Conclusion
Introduction to the Men’s Navy Blue Blazer

The beauty of the navy blue blazer jacket is that it goes with almost anything. By blazer jacket I mean the classic single-breasted navy wool coat with brass, horn, or plastic buttons.
Over gray flannel slacks, a white button-down oxford shirt and a striped tie, a blazer makes a classic outfit that registers just shy of a suit on the formality scale.
On the weekend, the same blazer over chinos and a polo shirt makes a very smart casual outfit. It would be impossible to list all of the handsome outfits a man can build around his navy blue blazer, but I will discuss some basic means of wearing it for work and leisure.
What a Man wears with a Navy Blazer

If you work in a business casual office, or not in any office at all, the navy blue blazer gives you a simple solution to the tricky problem of dressing respectably without appearing aloof.
In a workplace dominated by polo shirts and khakis, the man who has the class to throw a blazer on over the ensemble looks distinctive without standing out.
A men’s dress shirt with a button-down collar and gray flannels are also worthy accompaniments for a blazer; add a tie to take it up a notch. A point collar shirt formalizes the ensemble a tad more, and here one should stop.
Contrast collars really belong under a suit, and even if the formality of French cuffs were not an issue, having cuff-links next to brass sleeve buttons creates a discordant clash of shininess. For footwear, bluchers, loafers, and monkstraps are all good options.
The blazer outfits described above are also smart choices for dinner in a nice restaurant or a morning religious service. In fact, the blazer will serve you well for most weekend activities, from taking in a play to cheering on a girls’ softball team.
A men’s blazer looks aristocratic and dignified over an ecru turtleneck and your trusty gray flannels; for a laid-back look in the summer wear it with off-white pants and a bright polo.
While it is perfectly acceptable to wear a navy blue blazer with jeans, and indeed the combination can look very stylish, one must take care that pants and coat are not too close in color. This goes for any jacket and pants combination: if it’s not a suit, it shouldn’t look like one from a distance.
Matching Shoes with a Navy Blazer

Brown suede dress shoes match the navy blue blazer in versatility, and anything that looks good with the latter will too with the former (although neither are typically worn by the English).
Black shoes, other than oxfords and wingtips, are also fine complements.
Anytime you wear a blazer, you will do well to wear some sort of patterned socks, whether checked, striped, or argyle.
When you forgo a tie, your socks provide a great opportunity to inject a little pizzazz into your look, especially if you wear a solid shirt.
Matching Trousers to a Men’s Blazer

Bringing our focus to trousers, gray flannels are always an irreproachable choice to wear with a blazer although on days that involve a lot of walking or running you may be more comfortable in cotton chinos.
These may be made with or without pleats; which you choose will be determined by your body type and personal style – either look great with a blue blazer.
Besides the traditional khaki, they can look good in such colors as stone, hunter green, and wine red. On cold days, you will appreciate the added warmth of cavalry twills, while in the summer heat linen pants are a cool and comfortable choice to wear with a blazer.Moving on to dress shirts, as said above a button-down oxford is the classic blazer companion.
Besides solids, a broad variety of stripes and checks, including many that would look garish with a suit, mix well with a blazer. The latter’s dark, solid fabric looks good next to just about anything, and the shiny buttons amply counterweight bold patterns.
For a more casual look, go with a long-sleeve polo shirt or a turtleneck, depending on the climate. The urbane silk tee-shirt and tight-fitting knit shirt tend to clash in their modernity with the blazer’s long heritage, and work better with a suit jacket.
Navy Blazer and Men’s Sweaters

In cooler weather, you will want to don a sweater under your blazer jacket. Look to own sweaters made from wool or cashmere; they do an excellent job of retaining heat and do not add considerable bulk.
If you’re wearing a blazer without a tie, a cable-knit or argyle crew-neck will add some life to the outfit. The V-neck worn over a tie may also be patterned or textured, but can be solid as well.
Sweater vests, buttoned or without buttons, are always an option with a navy blazer.
A quick note on sweater color and pattern – I am an advocate of muted patterns and colors when it comes to knitwear – sweaters that scream with loud color and pattern are too memorable and limited in a wardrobe rotation.
Blues, greens, browns, and other natural tones complement almost any man, match well with a wide range of clothing to include the navy blazer, and are easy to find.
Matching Neckties, Pocket Squares, and Belts with a Navy Blazer

Finally, a few words on neckwear and accessories that should be worn with a navy blazer. Look to keep the tie you wear with a navy blazer sporty; woven silks in polka dots, bold stripes, and other simple patterns do this grandly, as do knits of silk or wool.
The bow tie with white shirt and blue blazer looks sophisticated on the few men who know precisely how and when to wear it, but goofy on most everyone else. Beyond ties, any pocket square that harmonizes with the rest of the outfit adds a dash of style to a blazer. For younger men, it will also ensure that a blazer and white shirt don’t look like a prep school uniform.
For belts, follow the old rule: match leather to leather, metal to metal. That means brown with brown shoes, although it can be a different shade of brown, and black with black. The buckle should be brass to coordinate with the blazer’s buttons.
The Men’s Navy Blazer – In Conclusion

The possibilities of what to wear with a navy blue blazer are endless. It is perhaps the best investment a man can make in his wardrobe, as it doubles the available outfits a man has each morning when he gets dressed. A blazer will serve nobly in a wide range of situations, and it will not go out of style in your lifetime."
https://atailoredsuit.com/match-tie-knot-shirt-collar-style.html,"There is a system for choosing the best tie knot style; simply put you should look to coordinate your necktie knot with your shirt collar’s shape.
Most men know how to tie a necktie one way; out of convenience, laziness, and blissful ignorance they match that one known knot with every shirt collar type they encounter.
Although not a crime, the mismatching of a tie knot with the collar style should be avoided for two reasons.
1. It fails to capture the natural harmony between the right tie knot’s lines and the shape of the shirt collar.
As any designer can expand upon, there are natural lines and proportions that appear to us as in harmony when matched – violating these rules we trigger a subconscious feeling of something being askew.
Not a feeling you want to evoke when the necktie knot is so close to your face.
2. Mismatching can cause the shirt collar or tie knot to look extremely large or small;
This makes you look like a clown instead of a gentleman. Example – a tight four in hand knot tied using a thin & lightweight tie mixed with a wide spread collar will over extenuate the collar’s extreme points making them look like a 1970’s flashback.
This is not the message a well dressed gentleman wants to send.
There are four things you should weigh when deciding which necktie knot to tie: 1) the shirt collar type, 2) your body type 3) necktie design and 4) tie construction.
How the dress shirt collar type affects what tie knot you should choose – As a general rule you want to match the knot to the shirt collar type, meaning that different shirt collars have varying notch sizes and point angles that create a range tie knot gap sizes.
A wide spread collar, whose points extend out an angle greater than 90 degrees, requires a larger and more triangular shaped necktie knot while a straight point collar, whose points extend out an angle less than 60 degrees, calls for a narrow and longer shaped tie knot.
Men with a larger neck size should wear a tie knot that fits proportionally. On the other hand tall and skinny men are better off wearing a slightly smaller and longish shaped knot.
Finally there is the necktie itself. Thicker Italian silk ties look better with a triangular shaped tie knot, such as the Double Windsor, while more traditional patterned ties, such as British striped ties, look best with a Four in Hand knot.
The Four in Hand Knot 
The Four in Hand knot is one of the oldest tie knots that originated in England towards the end of the 19th century.
It is said that British horsemen invented this type of knot when they were tying their scarves with one hand while holding the reigns of four horses in the other – hence the name “Four in Hand”.
The Four in Hand knot is one of the easiest tie knots to learn. The knot has a smaller, slightly longish shape that is perfect for narrow spread collars as well as for button down collar dress shirts.
The classic look of this knot is perfect for British striped, and Regimental ties.
Since the Four in Hand requires less of the tie’s length, it is also a great choice knot for tall men trying to tie a regular length tie to the right length – so that the tip of the tie ends near the center of the belt buckle.
The Half-Windsor
The half Windsor knot is the smaller version of the Windsor -sometimes also called double Windsor knot. The half Windsor has a more triangular shape than the Four in Hand knot.
It is a perfect choice knot for medium-width spread collars and thick designer ties.
Because the half Windsor requires less of the tie’s length than the larger Windsor knot, it is also a great choice for big & tall men trying to wear a regular length tie.
Of the four main knots, the half Windsor is the most versatile yet underutilized knot. You would do well to learn to tie this tie knot.
The Windsor Knot
The Windsor knot is sometimes also called “Full Windsor” or “Double Windsor”. It is the most searched necktie knot on the Internet today, and any regular tie wearer should know it.
However, out of all the tie knots described it is the one that will require the most practice and for most men is the knot they should use only on occasion (unless you only own wide spread collars!).
The Windsor knot has a larger triangular symmetric shape.
It is the perfect knot for wide spread collars, for modern striped and foulard patterned ties, as well as for men with a large neck.
Because the Windsor knot requires two wrappings, additional tie length is needed.
Therefore, tall men and men with a larger neck size will need a longer length tie. Extra long ties that typically measure 61 – 64 inches in length are needed here.
The Necktie “Dimple” 
Necktie aficionados go to great length to create the perfect necktie knot; the “cherry on top” of the perfect tie knot is the “dimple”. The dimple is a purposely created crease on top of the knot.
It adds a more textured look to the tie and gives the necktie a perfect drape. The dimple is created in the final steps when tying a tie. To make a dimpled tie knot, carefully fold a crease at the center of the tie.
Make sure that the crease goes all the way through, and even onto the back of the tie knot. Then, carefully tighten the tie knot while holding the crease in place. Creating a dimpled necktie knot takes a little bit of practice, but once mastered, adds the ultimate touch of sophistication to any men’s suit & tie ensemble."
https://atailoredsuit.com/three-piece-suit-introduction.html,"The rarity of three piece suits makes the ability to wear one a prized asset to any stylish man’s wardrobe. Check our list of the best three-piece suits!
Standing out in a crowd is as simple as adding a waistcoat – and when a simpler look is called for the vest can always be removed, unlike the equally striking but less flexible double-breasted jacket.
Waistcoats add to the character of a basic 2-piece suit; a matching fabric waistcoat can transform a two piece suit to a level below evening wear but above simple business dress while a contrasting odd vest can make a drab grey outfit (and the man wearing it) more lively and approachable.
The vested or three piece suit is the matched outgrowth of the waistcoat; it commonly consists of a single-breasted jacket, a waistcoat, and trousers all made from the same material and lining.
As this definition implies, an odd vest and suit – defined as a waistcoat made from a different fabric than the jacket and trouser – is not a true three piece suit.
As aforementioned, depending on the fabric chosen an odd vest can raise or lower the outfit’s formality.
However, for the purposes of this article we shall treat both outfits as three piece suits and use the words waistcoat and vest interchangeably.
For more information on men’s vests and waistcoats, click here.
Three piece suits were common until World War II, but lost their prominence when the War Board enforced cloth rationing that restricted tailors’ abilities to create vests.
Add in the returning veteran’s new taste for a vest-less jacket (thanks to his uniform), better heating in workspaces, and the lower cost to forgo the waistcoat entirely, we saw a sharp decline in men’s vest sales.
Since then the waistcoat has become an uncommon yet striking accent, going in and out of style regularly but always distinctive if worn well.
For a man seeking a distinctive style, the three piece suit has obvious merits. A man can safely assume he will be one of the only people wearing a vested suit at most social occasions.
It also creates a single, unbroken stretch of the suit fabric from ankles to shoulder. In a quality fabric, the smooth drape of cloth all the way along the body gives a man’s body a handsomely balanced appearance.
Worn on its own, the waistcoat of a three piece suit is usually an acceptable piece of dress-casual clothing.
The exception is any vest whose design clearly requires a jacket — the “backless” vests of formalwear are an excellent example; the simple straps that hold them together in the rear were never meant to be a visible element.
Any full vest that falls low enough to cover the belt/waistband is an acceptable accent over a dress shirt, however, and in casual settings the sleeves of the shirt can be rolled up for an old-fashioned nod to working-class styles of the early 20th Century.
Of course, a three piece suit can always become a two-piece suit through the simple expedient of leaving the waistcoat at home — unlike the double-breasted suit, the three-piece sacrifices no versatility for its elegance.
Its only drawback (so long as the rest of the suit is well-made) is the added cost of the third garment.
Vests are a surprisingly hard garment to fit properly — cautious tailors will often insist on making at least a shirt and a jacket for a man to familiarize themselves with his measurements and proportions before tackling a waistcoat.
A well-made waistcoat will be tailored with the assumption that it will sometimes be the outermost garment, meaning that the fit needs to be appropriate even at points that are usually hidden beneath the jacket.
The exception here is formal vests; since tuxedo or dinner jackets are never removed the accompanying waistcoats are often created “backless” for convenience and comfort and feature a simple strap in the back rather than a full span of cloth.
Nearly every point on a vest has relevant benchmarks for fit. At the bottom, the vest should be long enough to completely cover the waistband of the pants. Any visible shirt around the waist will destroy the top-to-bottom sweep of the suit fabric.
Too long of a vest starts to look absurd, so the trousers on a good three piece suit will be fitted high, around the natural waist, and should ideally be worn with suspenders.
A belt may cause bulging in the waistcoat fabric and will be completely hidden, rendering it unnecessary.
The top of the vest should be high enough to be visible when the jacket is buttoned (there wouldn’t be a lot of point in a vested suit if it was hidden half the time). An inch or two is ample, however — the vest should leave plenty of necktie visible, or else the man’s chest starts to look constricted.
The neckline should be broad enough that the fabric of the vest doesn’t cover the points of the shirt collar or slip beneath them.
A good waistcoat should be fitted; that is, it should have a distinct waist. Like a suit jacket, the fabric should come in at least slightly at the narrowest point on the wearer’s body. Most will be somewhat adjustable by means of a strap in the back.
The formality of a three piece suit is such that it requires a necktie. Since only a few inches of the tie are visible, the knot should be tied with extra care.
Particularly bulky ties (knits especially) may create a bulge under the front of the vest, and should be avoided. The end of the tie should not stick out from under the bottom of the waistcoat. If a tie is a good match but a touch too long, it can always be tucked into the trousers.
It is possible to wear a vested suit with a waistcoat that does not match the jacket and trousers. This is even less common than the usual matched approach and does bring the formality of the outfit down somewhat, but it can make for a very elegant appearance if the colors are chosen carefully.
Most suits with contrasting waistcoats are usually done in soft tones to avoid becoming too garish.
Dark green vests pair well with brown suits, or brown vests can be worn with navy jackets, and so on. So long as the colors are distinct enough to contrast but not so bright as to seem overstated an unmatched waistcoat is acceptable and even attractive (though still less formal than matched).
Avoid the brightly-colored vests that rental outlets sometimes suggest for formal dress — these are essentially a novelty, and have no place in any man’s regular wardrobe.
In an odd footnote to fashion, most waistcoats are designed with the understanding that the bottom button will be left undone. There is no practical reason for this.
The most popular explanation is that Edward VII of the United Kingdom began appearing in public with his bottom button undone, probably for comfort, and imitators picked the habit up until it became standard.
There is nothing wrong with leaving the bottom button fastened, but it may cause bunching if the vest was tailored with the expectation that it would be left undone.
Vested suits share most of their disadvantages with the double-breasted jacket. They must be kept buttoned for formality’s sake and they add a layer of cloth across the midsection that may be hot or uncomfortable in humid climates.
Small men risk looking swallowed by their clothing, and the vest creates an unbroken plane of fabric that can make tall men appear looming. Very wide men may have trouble fitting a vest that doesn’t seem to hang off the edge of their belly (though wearing the trousers high on the waist helps quite a bit).
Despite the drawbacks, the vested suit remains a worthwhile investment for men looking to add class and formality to their dress wardrobe. It offers a distinctive elegance, and in some settings the vest or the jacket over it can be removed to offer relief from the added layer of cloth.
The timeless style of the three piece suit is worth experimenting with for any man, whether it becomes a staple of his wardrobe or not."

Remember the Bride
Keep it Simple
People like to talk about weddings in superlative terms. Your wedding should be the “happiest” day of your life, the “most important” day of your life, the “biggest” day, and so on.
I’d like to think your wedding should also be one of your best-dressed days as well.
Whatever form your ceremony takes, it certainly merits your sharpest appearance.
In many cases it’s also going to require some coordination with groomsmen or general wedding themes. And since you’ll be making up 50% the pictures, thinking carefully about your clothing is almost as important as the bride’s (I have to be careful as a few brides may read this).
The options for dressing sharp on your wedding day are as varied as wedding ceremonies. However, these basic guidelines will steer any man straight.
At the end of the day the goal of your clothing is to help you be as good looking as you possibly can be. Your wedding is a special moment, and your appearance should be as well.
Your outfit should be a classic example of whatever style you’ve chosen. Tuxedo wearers will want to be a textbook image of black-tie style – suits wearers should be fitted perfectly and ornamented with a carefully made boutonniere.
I emphasize classic not because I want you to dress like your grandfather (which actually might not be a bad idea) but rather I don’t want you to timestamp your wedding photos. In the same way many of my female friends can time-date a picture based of the height of their big hair (think late 80’s and early 90’s), going with a trendy look is just that – trendy. Instead opt for suit styles and silhouettes that are timeless.
A simple two piece suit is often the simplest and most striking option for a groom.
Fancier options like tuxedos and morning coats are often rental-dependent in the United States unless a man and all his wedding party happen to own formal dress clothing already.
They also come with rules of style that many men may not be entirely familiar with.
If you want the men in the wedding to look sharp, are on a strict budget, and wish to avoid risking a faux pas – stick to the single breasted men’s suit.
Also, you don’t need to purchase a new suit for your wedding if you already have a simple, solid-color suit in charcoal gray or dark navy.
This may sounds strange coming from a man who sells clothing for a living, but these dark formal colors are entirely appropriate for a wedding day and many men will be just fine using a suit already in their wardrobe assuming it’s in excellent condition.
Worn with a white or other light colored shirt and a simple tie, a dark solid colored suit gives a man an understated elegance that pairs well with most bridal styles and fits the importance of the occasion. By the same token, if a new suit is needed it’s never a bad purchase. The new suit, assuming a quality garment is purchased, remains useful after the wedding as a piece of dress clothing ready for business or other semi-formal occasions.
The best wedding suits are a charcoal gray suit or deep navy blue suit, although lighter grey, khaki, and blue suits have their place in the summer months and at exotic locales.
Avoid brightly-colored suits as are novelty item and too gaudy for a wedding unless you are getting married in Vegas. In that case email me a picture.
In the United States we have a bad habit of planning our weddings around specific color themes. I realize that most of the grooms reading this have little control over this, but if you can resist.
It’s OK for a high school prom – not for grown adults looking to publically share their vows. You should aim to not exactly match your necktie, boutonnière, and pocket squares but rather have them complement you and the bride.
Lastly try to avoid heavy patterning which distracts the eye and can clash with bridal styles.
Formal patterning like pin-stripes has business associations that are out of place at a celebratory event. Keep to a solid or semi-solid dark suit for the most elegant look.
Black suits are sometimes seen as a more relaxed version of a tuxedo for wedding garb. That’s a somewhat imperfect understanding. Black is a high-formality color, but because of its associations with tuxedos and evening wear it may not actually be appropriate for a wedding setting.
Wearing black indoors has the unfortunate effect of washing out many men’s complexions and creating a stark contrast that overpowers in photographs. Also groomsmen and guests are less likely to own a pure black suit than they are a more conventional gray or blue suit, so it may not wind up being much more convenient than the fancier black tie or morning dress options anyway.
The groom does not typically match the bride and should avoid a white suit. White is traditionally bridal and an overwhelmingly white color palette tends to wash the couple out. If your bride is wearing a traditional white dress we strongly recommend a colored suit.
Unless you’re dead set to the idea of a black or white suit, consider a charcoal gray or navy blue instead. These colors are easier to match, much more practical in terms of availability, and are classic staples that have been used for decades.
A wedding suit doesn’t have to be a simple single-breasted, two-button jacket — though it certainly can be. Single-breasted jackets are understated, simple, and dignified.
If you feel the need for a little more exuberance on your wedding day, a double-breasted suit adds weight and formality to the outfit, but is a high-formality garment that should only be worn with a necktie and a formal dress shirt. An open collar isn’t an option with a double-breasted jacket. They may also be less comfortable for prolonged wear, especially when sitting.
An equally formal yet more versatile option is a three-piece suit ensemble; this adds formality and elegance to the basic men’s suit by matching it with a vest. Matched waistcoats fill a similar role to double-breasted jackets, but can always be removed to make the outfit a simple single-breasted two-piece suit.
Wedding photographers usually like to get “relaxed” shots of the groom in just his waistcoat and shirt, often with a jacket slung over a shoulder, so be prepared to do some taking off and putting on of clothing if you go with the vested suit.
Looking your best — the goal for the big day — is about getting the details right. A clean white dress shirt is a solid and formal choice for a wedding day. Patterns are fine for the audience and the groomsmen, but you want the formality of a solid colored shirt.
Light shades of blue, off-white, and cream are acceptable as long as it doesn’t clash with the brides dress. Remember that your shirt collar is going to be in every picture you’re in, so make sure it fits.
If you decide to skip the necktie (see below) make sure you are wearing a dress shirt with a collar whose points stay out of your way. A medium spread is a solid choice here, and consider dress shirt collar stays to ensure the points do not fold.
Lastly don’t underestimate the importance of an undershirt on your wedding day — you’re going to be sweating and it’s better to have a layer of extra protection.
Your choice of necktie is important because of its proximity to your face. Like the dress shirt collar, your necktie color and pattern will take up more than its fair share of attention in the photos and video shot that day. This is not the time for a novelty tie or bright color – instead select a subdued pattern and color.
Look for a tie with a single strong base color in blue, green, gold or earth tones with a modest pattern on it keeps you looking elegant without seeming too stark. Avoid red neckties as they are more for power business meetings.
Look to a classic oxford balmorals that complement your suit’s fabric. Bluchers are acceptable if you plan on wearing a lighter colored suit or suit without a tie. In any case ensure your shoes are well-shined and they should match your belt (close, no need to exactly match).
How much matching you want to hold your groomsmen to is up to you, but please note there is no style law that commands that your groomsmen should match.
In fact I advise you steer away from this and instead encourage looks that complement each other, not match exactly.
A wedding party of men in similar-colored but distinctively-cut suits is more striking than one with perfectly coordinated outfits because it looks natural, not contrived.
Black tie weddings are very popular in the United States; over the last 50 years we have seen them grow in popularity as engaged couples look to make their wedding outfits more formal that 2 piece suits but not something that harks of a bygone era (see morning dress below).
Now I do need to point out that technically black tie is evening wear and should not be worn until 5PM in the evening.
Now having said this, if you and your bride are set on a black-tie wedding you should then look to dress appropriately. You want to assemble a classic black tie outfit, one that will stand the test of time and never go out of style.
Please read this article to acquaint yourself with the details of black tie attire. Although wearing black tie is often more costly than a suit, it is actually easier to wear as the rules governing it’s assembly is very cut and dry – to wear a tuxedo classically is to follow the same rules your grandfather did.
I highly recommend that if you go down the black tie route you own your tuxedo; failure to get a proper fit and the renting of a poorly made garment made from synthetic materials will result in you being uncomfortable and sweaty all day. Not something you want on your wedding day.
Remember that most men do not own a black tie ensemble – they’ll need at least a few months notice to rent or order a tuxedo. If going the rental route try to accommodate those that own their own (they will prefer to wear it) and ensure all the groomsmen try on the clothing two weeks before to ensure proper fit.
Finally, beware brightly-colored novelty tuxedos or black tie imitation wear that is too fashion forward; the only message this will send on your wedding day is that you clearly do not have a sense of style.
Men with a respect for the daylight/evening divide who want the most formal wedding possible can turn to the traditional “morning dress” standard.
Morning suits consist of a single-breasted tailcoat and a vest (usually in contrasting colors), a high turn-down or wing collar with the appropriate neckwear, and striped or checked trousers.
The style is meant to evoke the formality of upper-class and aristocratic events, though it was originally considered casual wear in exactly those settings.
It is now a highly formal and a very rare style of dress seen occasionally in the UK and sparingly here in the States.
Morning dress is an exacting outfit. It requires articles of clothing that very few men own and even many tailors will be challenged to properly assemble all the needed items.
Purchases or rentals must be done from a very knowledgeable tailor to ensure that all the rules are followed appropriately.
While striking, this is undoubtedly one of the most stressful options among traditional wedding attires.
The bride’s outfit will outshine yours in terms of opulence and extravagance. This is natural and expected. Your outfit should complement rather than compete with hers.
Don’t be afraid to compare notes closely with the bridal party if you’re not already.
If you can provide your tailor with photos or sketches of her dress before having anything made specifically for the wedding. If your outfit is planned before hers, do the reverse — make sure her tailor or seamstress has a solid idea of what you and your wedding party will be wearing before any expensive work is started.
Weddings are an endless parade of details; try to make dressing for yours a simple one. Honestly, how you dress for your wedding should be a simple affair. Consider your options, review your budget, check with the interested parties, and make your decision months before the appointed date.
A simple and classic wedding outfit will go a long way toward helping making your big day one to remember.

Men’s dress shoes come in many styles, and each has its place.
The particular constructions and colors one chooses are surely a matter of personal style.
Nonetheless, there are a few conventions one should keep in mind when selecting shoes for purchase, or deciding which pair to don on a particular day.
In general, the sleeker the shoe, the more formal; black is generally more formal than brown.
Lace-ups rank ahead of slip-ons, and closed lacing is a notch above open lacing.
(In the closed lacing construction, the sides of the shoe emerge from the top side by side and fan slightly outward to form a V where the laces tie them together.
A shoe with open lacing has separate side pieces folded over the tongue to meet at the center). Broguing–rows or patterns of perforations–take shoes down in formality, the more so the more there are.
Please Note – These are edited photos from the fine men’s shoe store Leffot – Contact them if you wish to purchase shoes.
The gold standard of dress shoes, the Oxford bal features round toes, usually with a cap, and closed lacing.
Plain cap-toe Balmoral Oxfords are the most formal option for business wear, and can do double-duty as black tie formal shoes.
Oxfords with broguing along the cap’s edge, or trimming the uppers, are still formal enough for a worsted wool suit; ‘full brogues’ are more appropriate with tweed or flannel.
If you own one pair of dress shoes, they should be black Balmoral Oxfords; Allen-Edmonds Park Avenue’s, made in the United States, are an irreproachable selection and well worth their price. Alden is another great manufacturer to consider.
The Blucher or Derby as it is sometimes called is similar in shape to the balmoral oxford (and is in fact an oxford, though rarely called so), but bears open lacing and is therefore considered less formal.
It is still appropriate for wear with a suit in the United States (though be careful overseas), and supports a khakis and blazer look more naturally than the balmoral oxford.
The blucher is a slightly sleeker open-laced shoe of similar versatility.
Plain or with a brogued cap, these dress shoes will match a suit in formality; with more decoration they carry a blazer well. In suede, rather than smooth leather, these are among the best shoes to wear with jeans or khakis although a sharp dresser can pull of this look.
The wing-tip, with a brogued cap coming to a point at the center of the top curving back and down along the sides, is suit-level in black and business casual in brown – the latter matching very well with gray flannel trousers.
In the United States, it is associated by many with Ronald Reagan and the eighties in general, and in any country it is going to draw some attention to itself.
This is not necessarily a bad thing, of course, but it does reduce the shoe’s potential for frequent wear.
While you might wear the same pair of brown Oxford’s three days a week without anyone noticing, the man who wears wing-tips more than weekly risks having them integrated into his reputation.
Dress boots bring some ruggedness to dress footwear, making them a worthy option in the winter.
In addition, their slip on and off feature along with superior comfort make them a favorite among travelers and those not requiring the formality of the oxford balmoral.
In the same family, but of a more regional nature, is the cowboy boot.
Although men like former Texas congressional representative Charlie Wilson could pull this off, most men might want to skip on this unless they are an oil magnate.
Slip-on shoes are casual by nature.
Those appropriate for business casual wear include bit loafers, with a metal link across the middle; monkstraps, with a buckle closure; and penny loafers, with a slotted leather band across the top.
Tassel loafers, which are exactly what they sound like, are accepted as business formal in some circles while relegated to weekend wear in others.
Casual slip-ons can be worn with jeans; dressier variants should be matched with an odd trouser.
White bucks are Oxfords made of white buckskin, a rough leather than in reality is not exactly white.
They are the traditional companion to the seersucker suit, and equally complement such summer fabrics as tan gabardine and white linen.
Thus, they could be called professional between Memorial Day and Labor Day, or during whatever one considers summer.
Patent leather oxfords are the most formal of men’s shoes; they are standard with a men’s tuxedo, and clash with most everything else.
Opera pumps, shiny black slippers with a bow on top, are another option for formal wear and have been worn by kings, statesmen, poets, and other well dressed men for 100 years."
https://atailoredsuit.com/how-to-choose-tailor.html,"Choosing a tailor used to be easy.
You either went with the tailor who had been servicing your father or you headed to the knowledgeable suit salesman who would make the proper introduction.
Today unfortunately, the task is harder.
Good tailors are hard to come by, and the average menswear salesman does not have the knowledge to point you in the right direction.
In this article, I equip you with the tools to find a reputable men’s tailor whose services can transform you and your clothing.
The below steps are in order of action to be taken, and are meant to be used in conjunction with one another to select a competent tailor.
The first point is very important, and should not be skipped.
Before you talk with a tailor or seamstress, you need to have a foundation in the basics of men’s style.
The hardest thing for most men to do is to find a few hours to sit down and read about suits, shirts, and other menswear; however most men find once they start reading the material they become enthralled.
Reading about the intricacies of quality menswear you start noticing men’s clothing details you never saw before.
You begin to pay attention to the fit of suit jackets, working sleeve buttonholes, and the break on a pair of trousers.
Stepping into the world of menswear, you’ll realize just how important your clothing is in sending messages about who you are.
Most people you pass by everyday know you only by the clothing you wear
Your appearance is the only way they can make any sense of who you are and what you do in this world.
The suit, shirt, and tie combination you put on in the morning covers 90% of your body.
Before you open your mouth, this garment combination and the way it fits on your body announces who you are and signals to others whether or not you deserve attention.
To build a solid foundation in the basics of men’s style, I recommend reading any book by Alan Flusser, Nicholas Antongiavanni’s “The Suit”, or Bernhard Roetzel’s “Gentleman” and spending time in A Tailored Suit’s Style Guide.
Once you have a foundation, you should then seek clarification and interact with knowledgeable people at places like Style Forum, an online community of men’s clothing enthusiasts.
When you find you can speak the tongue of custom menswear, you are ready to start interviewing tailors.
Be careful here – most men are not selective in choosing their tailor, and stay with their current tailor only because they are unaware of a better option.
Combined with the fact most men do not understand what proper fit is, it is very possible that a tailor who receives high praise only does so because of the cluelessness of his patrons.
Do not assume because someone calls themselves a tailor or seamstress that they know anything about men’s style or can assess proper fit.
Take a critical look at your friends – who among them are smart dressers?
These are the people you want to ask for tailor recommendations. You can broaden your search by asking women as well, but be careful.
The way clothes fit on a man versus the way they should fit on a woman is very different.
A skilled woman’s tailor does not necessarily have the right skills to tailor men’s clothing.
You now have a list of tailors – next you need to start talking with them.
You can do this over the phone or even email, but your goal is to see if this is a person you can work with. Do they have good communication skills?
Do they actually listen to you, or are they trying to push in a direction you know you don’t want to go down?
Do they have time to talk, or are they in a rush?
To be fair, you shouldn’t hold the last one against them if you call their office out of the blue – but any professional should be willing to put aside 20 minutes to speak with a potential client at a set time within a few days of calling.
You want to work with a tailor whom you feel confident in.
This decision is very personal and should be based off the tailor’s knowledge and communication skills – ideally you find a tailor with strong skills in both areas. Unfortunately, a combination of the two is rare except in larger cities.
You can have a very skilled tailor, but if he does not understand you or feels he should ignore your wishes and do what he thinks is right, both parties are going to be disappointed. Communication is vital, and making certain that both sides clearly understand and respect each other is key to a long term partnership.
There is one answer here; the tailor should not be satisfied until you are satisfied.
This doesn’t mean that a skilled tailor or seamstress always gives you what you want or doesn’t make mistakes – no, a tailor really worth keeping is one who learns what your idea of the perfect fit is and constantly works to achieve this.
I mentioned this earlier, but do not assume a tailor or seamstress understands classic men’s style.
Although many skilled tailors are experts at building anything you can imagine, their eye for what color fabric or style of jacket suits a man is often at odds with reality.
Culture differences can also play a factor here, as that many of the most skilled tailors today are native Chinese, Thai, or Indian – what worked in Mumbai in 1970 may not be applicable today.
With your foundation in classic men’s style you should be able to figure out quickly if the tailor possess an eye for timeless fashion.
Pictures, example pieces, alteration miracles – you are looking for samples of their work that validate the tailor’s claims of greatness.
If the overall garment looks good, spend a few minutes studying the details
Does the stitching look secure and clean, is the build and silhouette something you want in your clothing. Be wary of a tailor who doesn’t have anything to show or happy customers to refer you to.
The best tailors out there are very busy people.
They have more work than they can handle, and unfortunately wait times of more than a month are not unheard of.
Ideally you want a tailor who can attend to your needs quickly, especially when you need a quick fix before an important appointment. Be upfront about your needs here, as that most tailors will accommodate emergencies knowing it creates loyalty and goodwill.
Notice I didn’t mention Price – this is the least important factor and should be a minor consideration even for those tight on money. You want to find a skilled tailor who can help you realize your vision of the perfect custom fit. Saving twenty dollars and not getting what you want is a waste of money – spend a little more and getting exactly what you pictured is always worth it.

Outerwear for Formal Dress
Most men view dressing for a black tie event as an awkward and unpleasant necessity, as a rite of passage reserved for high school proms and weddings, or both.
This is not entirely unfair, especially the latter part. Black tie is, by definition, for special occasions — occasions so special that they their own unique uniform. That’s what makes black tie so impressive.
Your best business suit may look good, but it remains something that you can wear for business.
At a social event, it’s just standing in. A tuxedo is something specific to the occasion, and that makes it more impressive.
Fortunately for men struggling with their first black tie event, the formal dress code is just that — it’s a code, with very specific guidelines. Anyone who sticks within the basic guidelines will look just fine.
Unfortunately, most rental outlets (and a good number of for-purchase manufacturers as well) will offer garments that violate these rules shamelessly. Don’t be tempted. Stick to the timeless traditions of formal wear, and you’ll be black-and-white elegance incarnate.
A dinner jacket or tuxedo jacket is not a suit coat.
A single-breasted jacket is the most common and most widely-accepted style, and at its most formal it should always be unvented — that is, there should not be any slits up the back of the jacket.
An unadorned “shawl” lapel, where the lapel runs in a simple ribbon from the button around the back of the neck, is the most classic black tie option.
Peaked lapels, with upward-sweeping points near the collar, are appropriate and preferred by some men for the added flair, but it is worth remembering that black tie is defined by understated elegance.
The simple shawl collar is usually the better choice unless a man has a serious social reason for wearing a more attention-drawing option.
Notched lapels are offered by some manufacturers, but are generally considered to be inappropriate for formalwear and should be avoided.
Dinner jackets are almost always black, with either satin or grosgrain on the front of the lapels.
Midnight blue is equally acceptable, but like the peaked lapel will be the less-common option in a crowd, and a man should carefully consider whether or not it is appropriate to stand out to a greater degree before choosing these options.
White jackets are also a style of formalwear, but they follow their own etiquette and should not be worn to events designated as “black tie.”
Formal wear is, by definition, matched. Trousers should always be made from the same fabric as the jacket, and the fabric on the seams should match the lapel facings.
A single braid is the most traditional seam adornment, but a simple, narrow band of fabric is equally-appropriate and far more common today (the braid, however, remains a sign of high-quality formal trousers). There will be no cuffs, as they would interfere with the seam decoration.
Formal trousers are meant to be worn with a waist covering (either a waistcoat or a cummerbund) and therefore are worn with suspenders.
There is no such thing as a formal belt, and anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to sell you something useless. This means that the trousers will sit high on the natural waist, usually near the bellybutton and well above the hips.
Most formal trousers will have pleated fronts, and this is by far the better-looking option.
Formal waistcoats are not vests in the same style as a three-piece suit’s third piece, though they are usually called by the same name.
They button low across the torso, leaving the front of the shirt largely visible.
Most black-tie waistcoats have their own lapels, or else are fronted entirely with the same fabric as the jacket’s lapels.
Some waistcoats will be “backless” and fasten with a buckled strap in the back rather than the buttons in the front, but vests in this style are no more or less formal than those with working buttons — it is simply a design to increase comfort and reduce the amount of fabric used.
The alternative to waistcoats, cummerbunds were originally considered a more casual style and limited to summer and outdoor wear.
Today, a black cummerbund is considered a perfectly acceptable alternative to a waistcoat, and is probably the more common option at most stores and rental outlets.
The pleats on the cummerbund face upward — think of them as tiny pockets, since that was their original function.
Men used to tuck theater or train tickets into the folds, and occasionally still do. Some cummerbunds will have actual pockets hidden on the backside, but the pleats should of course still face upward.
Black Tie Men’s Shirts 
The dress shirt beneath a black tie jacket is always white; there is no room for negotiation here.
Collars should ideally be turndown, with the collar points hidden behind the bowtie, but modern black tie (particularly in America) has come to accept the sharply-pointed wing collar as well.
Traditionalists consider the wing collar too ostentatious for proper black tie, but it is still widely available; men are here, as with peaked lapels, encouraged to consider carefully how much they want to draw attention specifically to their outfits.
Well-made dress shirts should always have a doubled-over “bib” of fabric up the front of the garment, usually decorated with narrow, closely-spaced pleats.
The shirt fastens with studs, not buttons, which should always match the cufflinks and are generally restricted to black, gold, or mother-of-pearl, with black being the most common.
The black bow tie defines an entire style, and as such deserves a bit of respect. Pre-tied and clip-on models are simply out.
A fixed-length tie of a length appropriate to your neck is always preferable to adjustable models as well; the latter will have excess fabric that doubles over and adds an unsightly bulge to the knot when tied.
To keep the tie proportional to your face, try to make sure that the ends of the bow fall somewhere between the edge of your face and the outer corners of your eyes — anything smaller will make your head look oversized.
The material of the tie should match the jacket’s lapel facings visually; shiny ties with soft-fronted lapels will create a glaring breach of the outfit’s uniformity.
Someone who expects to wear black tie regularly will want to invest in the classic formal footwear: patent leather pumps with a black ribbon bow on the front.
Modern dressers tend to accuse traditional black tie pumps of looking like either women’s shoes or slippers, but this forgets the overall purpose of black tie, which is to provide an outfit unique to the occasion — in their traditional form, men’s formal pumps are only suited to indoors wear. It speaks of luxury and sophistication, and is exclusive to the formal style.
For most men, a pair of shoes strictly for black tie events is an excessive investment. Modern black tie standards allow for any black, patent-leather dress shoe in a simple and formal style, with plain-toe oxfords being the ideal.
It is possible to get away with regular black leather dress shoes if they are polished to a highly-reflective shine, but even small scuffs or scrapes will immediately show that these are not “the real thing.”
Leaving the house without a pocket square is as unacceptable to the well-dressed man as leaving without underwear, and black tie makes no exception.
A white linen handkerchief should always grace a black tie pocket, folded to your preference — some modern gentlemen have even begun simply slipping the pocket square in and letting it take its own shape, adding an eye-catching irregularity to the otherwise-uniform ensemble.
More traditional folds are always acceptable, but try to avoid pre-made pocket squares with a permanent fold in them — these are easy to spot by experienced eyes, and rank alongside clip-on bow ties as a beginner’s mistake.
Tuxedo and Black Tie Boutonnieres 
A boutonniere — small flower in the buttonhole of the left lapel — is an option of formal wear that may or may not be appropriate to exercise depending on the event.
Only a few flowers are considered “true” boutonnieres, and not all florists will know the limits of traditional formal dress or be able to trim flowers so that they fit the buttonhole neatly.
If you are confident in your florist and feel that the event is casual enough to allow a bit of personalized color among the guests, a small, fresh flower is a wonderful accoutrements to a black-tie event.
Military events, particularly Armistice Day observances, will occasionally state that red poppies may be worn, in which case the proper etiquette is obviously to wear the flower as a gesture of remembrance.
In the winter, an overcoat will be needed for the journeys to and from black tie events. The coat should always be dark, either black or midnight blue or a very dark gray, and it should not be made of an obviously-artificial material like Gore-Tex or nylon.
Some men accompany their jacket with a white, tasseled scarf called an opera scarf or with suede gloves in dark gray or black.
A modest black hat is also acceptable, with fedoras and homburgs being the most common choices — stocking caps are obviously unacceptable, and top hats, while elegant, are best reserved for wear with tailcoats (aka white tie).

https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-overcoats-topcoats.html,"When the rain and the snow fall, the wind blows, and the temperature drops, we don protective outer garments out of necessity.
For the tailored man, the outer layer of choice will be the overcoat: a heavy, knee-length coat with a collar and lapels.
In the colder months, the overcoat is an easy style move that distinguishes the well-dressed from the dressed up.
However stately a man’s suit, if he walks in off the street with a ski parka covering it, the parka will define the first impression he makes and the suit will look discordant when it comes into the light.
On the other hand, when you walk in draped in a knee-length coat with your scarf smartly knotted around your neck, you make a distinguished impression that will stick even if you take it off to reveal a polo shirt and blue jeans.
Of all the garments we wear, the overcoat has perhaps changed the least over the past century, so that one of high quality is truly a long-term investment.
The single-breasted overcoat is the most common, and for good reason.
On bright fall and winter days, it can be worn without a scarf, or with one just trimming the lapels, to display your shirt and tie.
In the freezing wind and snow, double your scarf around your neck and turn the collar up for protection from the elements.
Besides the single-breasted standard, overcoats may be double breasted, with or without a belt.
The belted model is sometimes called a polo coat. Black, charcoal, and navy blue will each frame any shirt and tie you have on underneath.
Should you tire of wearing the same dark overcoat day after day, there are other options.
Camelhair has long been a favorite of the New England aristocracy, thanks to its incomparable troika of warmth, durability, and softness.
Given its pedigree, the natural beige color of pure camelhair is exempt from the traditional rules of color matching for formality’s sake, although all materials are equal before the judgment seat of aestheticism.
Checks are traditional for fall and spring weight coats, and can be found on heavier ones as well; for the gentleman who enjoys mixing and matching patterns they offer an opportunity to add another ingredient to the stew.
Subtle horizontal stripe patterns are as versatile as solids, and give one a dandified touch.
The particular coat one chooses should be first a question of insulation (you’ll need more the farther North you live), and second of personal style. If you are unsure where to start, you cannot go wrong with black; just find one that’s warm enough for you.
The coats sold in stores are usually only available in even sizes, since their appearance is less sensitive to fit than that of a suit.
Nonetheless, many men choose to order bespoke overcoats, since this allows for a perfect fit with accompanying superior insulation. If your body type is such that off-the-rack clothes never fit you, overcoats are likely no exception, and bespoke will be your best option."

Seasons and Dress Shirts Conclusion
Introduction to Understanding Seasons and Dress Shirts
Although your natural features are the dominant factors in determining what color clothing a man should wear, they are not the only things you should pay attention to.
A well dressed gentleman also gives attention to the seasons, paying heed to the effect the colors around him have on the ensemble he has put together.
The dark two-piece suit and dark colored custom dress shirt you decide to wear may look magnificent on you, but at a summer wedding you’ll find yourself not only hot under the collar but sticking out like a sore thumb.
Let’s take a quick look at the seasons and the shades of color they invoke.
A man dresses for spring 
Spring is the season of re-birth. It’s here that pinks, lavenders, and lighter shades of blue compliment a man.
Whites are also an excellent choice, and depending on the weather now may be a good time to wear any dress shirts made with man made fibers; as things warm up you will want to start wearing natural fibers.
Overall lighter weight fabrics are dusted off from their winter sleep, and a man would speak well of himself to wear multi-colored checks and stripes that complement that are light and not overpowering.
Summer colors for a man
Summer is a season when light and bold colors dominate the scene, and for good reason.
The hot weather makes not only light shades practical, but your choice of your fabric’s fiber will mean the difference between allowing your skin to breath or you sweltering like in a sauna.
100% cottons, linens, and silks are popular fabric choices because of their wicking qualities.
Gold striped shirts, red checks, and of course a wide variety of blue solids and patterns should grace the wardrobe of the well dressed man.
Fall men’s colors
Earth Tones and heavier fabrics begin to make their appearance.
Clothing tends to take on a somber appearance with the onset of cooler weather, and now with the weather getting cooling up, is a good time to start wearing blends again.
Their heat retention qualities are good on a cold evening you are caught without an overcoat.
Fancy checks and stripes with more color than white are excellent choices, and muted tones of blue on broadcloth or chambray are great selections.
A Man and Winter colors
Dark colors and heavy fabric such as flannels, twills, and oxfords make their appearance.
You can enliven your wardrobe a bit with a pink or maize dress shirt, or show off a burgundy check that’s been in your closet for a few months.
Remember that winter is the season you want to get your money’s worth from the fabrics designed to keep you warm, and there is nothing like the feel of a heavy flannel dress shirt as it staves off the cold north winds.
Forest green and brown tones are a stable during this season, although they tend to be perceived as more casual.
Seasons and Dress Shirts – Conclusion
It’s important to remember that confidence in one’s appearance is vital to looking great.
When people look at you a tad longer than usual, you need to have the confidence in your outfit to know that it’s because you look that good (as opposed to looking that bad!).
Our advice is to have the courage to know yourself, and from that knowledge choose the colors that best complements you as an individual."

5 Reasons to Purchase Custom Clothing Online
Today, most of us think it’s antiquated to spend a full day and tank of gas traveling around town when the best deal is online. Then why do so many men still purchase their clothing this way?
With liberal return policies and low shipping costs, shopping online is a no-brainer.
The average man spends 30 hours shopping before he finds a suit that he like and fits him – both large & small men spend even more time searching for garments that fit them in key areas properly.
Being 6 foot plus is great for basketball, but a pain when it comes to finding a shirt with long enough sleeves.
Shorter than 5’6”? We know your pain of having to look in the boys section for a suit that isn’t too long. In this article we’ll address five reasons a man should consider purchasing custom menswear online.
1. MUCH wider Fabric and Style Selection
When you walk into a menswear store, you see suits everywhere. But most of this is superfluous, as that what you want is only a small fraction of what is available.
Use the Men’s Warehouse as an example: I walk in and ask for a light gray pin striped single breasted suit in size 44. Although I have only specified three factors, I have nonetheless reduced the Men’s Wearhouse inventory of 2000 suits to maybe 2 or 3 garments that fit that description.
Now imagine if I asked for something a little more fashion forward, say slanted pockets and peak lapels. It’s unlikely the Men’s Wearhouse, Brooks Brothers, or Jos. A Bank would have a men’s suit jacket like this in their entire nationwide inventory.
With custom clothing selection is never a problem; your choices are unlimited.
What you ask for is made to your specifications; no compromises. The garment you have made is a one-of-kind masterpiece of fabric and thread.
2. Clothing Customization Options
This goes hand in hand with selection; with a custom bespoke suit, you are free to adjust as many aspects of your suit’s style as you wish.
There are no such things as strange requests; need one sleeve longer than the other (most men’s arm are not the same length!) – done.
Are you a detective and need a suit that hides the bulge of your weapon – easy. Do you want to make a statement with a flashy lining – what color?
Custom clothing is just that; Custom. Try asking for this at Brooks Brothers, the Men’s Wearhouse or at Jos. A Bank!
3. Better Clothing Quality and Build
When you have a custom garment created, you are giving a very specific set of instructions to an artist who wants to realize your vision. They work their magic with your chosen fabrics, and the final product is their handmade creation, not a stale cutout from a factory.
Quality is higher because each garment is individually created, inspected, and tested. You won’t find that even at Brooks Brothers.
4. Transparency on Price and Build Quality
One of the most powerful aspects of the web is how it forces a seller to lay his wares for all to inspect and see – as a buyer you have the power to walk away with the click of a mouse.
You can shop for as long as you wish, look wherever you may choose, and at the end of the day the vendor must convince you his product has more value than the hard earned dollars you are parting with.
It is this transparency that makes buying a custom men’s suit or dress shirt online great.
You design exactly what you want, and can on your schedule ask for clarification on anything that concerns you in regards to the purchase.
You control the tempo and speed. No getting caught in a sales speech and the emotion it is meant to arouse.
You should ask and expect a response for the privilege of your business.
5. Time is Money
I mentioned this earlier, but it deserves reiteration. Your time has value. If you earn $100+ a day, then a day spent shopping costs you at least this amount.
So what did you gain by shopping for 10 hours only to buy a suit that neither fits nor is the color or style you actually desire.
It is always worth paying more for quality and getting what you want versus buying cheap and settling for something inferior that you will never like.
A suit’s whole purpose is to present a man to his viewers in the best possible light. Do your suits and shirts help you feel confident?
Custom clothing is not for everyone.
There are those out there who fit perfectly into off the rack suits, are not interested in customization, are not concerned with quality, like to be pressured into a sale they don’t know everything about, and have plenty of time to waste.
If you don’t fit this description, you may want to explore the online custom clothing option."
https://atailoredsuit.com/proper-fit-mens-clothing.html,"Contrary to popular belief, men’s dress clothes should always be comfortable.
If they are not, it is the fault of the clothes’ fit, and not of their nature.
Suffering for beauty’s sake does not do a man any good, either; if the fit of a garment makes its wearer uncomfortable, he will look it.
Indeed, a man looks his best when his clothes fit so well he barely notices them.
On the other hand, if his suit or dress shirt are too tight, they will be pulling and choking at every turn; too loose, and a man looks like he has had to borrow some clean clothes from his older brother as he struggles to keep them out of the way.
A man’s clothes send a message to the world about him, and if they fit him well, he will always make a good impression.
Most men today wear poorly-fitting clothes, and it is not hard to see why. The menswear sold in stores are cut to fit as many men as possible, and that means big.
At the same time, the fashion-industrial complex creates new so-called styles by bending or breaking the time-honored traditions in menswear;
Thus it is that designers and commentators may debate whether baggy or fitted pants are ‘in’ this season while neither look as good as the timeless middle-ground.
A good deal of men still rely on women to hold their hands through shopping trips, but since the prerogatives of fit are altogether different for women’s clothing, the results are often sorry.
Finally, when you are buying a garment, the retailer has little incentive to tailor it properly, since nobody seeks out a mall store because he’s heard they do great alterations.
Thus as in so many things, it falls to each man to take responsibility for the fit of his own clothes, and not to be swayed by the prolific selection of poor choices or the dubious influence of models, salesmen, and the opposite sex.
The first step in acquiring properly fitting clothes is knowing what proper fit looks like.
In general, clothes should be comfortable, but not loose. Pants should be worn at the natural waist, near the navel. Young people with flat stomachs may choose to wear them lower, as has been the style for a decade or so, but they gain little in doing so.
The man with a belly, on the other hand, looks much better with high-rise trousers draping from his middle than with his stomach spilling over a low-rise waistband.The trouser cuff’s bottoms should touch your shoes’ uppers, but of course must not touch the ground. The most standard length brushes the top edge of the sole at the back, for a slight break in the front.
Shorter pant legs, just brushing the tops of the shoes, can look better on the shorter man, and also allow one to show off his socks and shoes should he care to do so.
Additionally, men under 5’9″ do better without cuffs on their trousers, but should they want them they should be in proportion to their stature, 1¼”-1½”, while men over six feet take cuffs 1¾”-2″.
If a jacket, meanwhile, is to have any hope of looking good, it must fit correctly in the chest and shoulders.
When you stand with your jacket buttoned and arms hanging loosely at your sides, the jacket’s lapels should lie flat against the front panels, the buttons should hang close to or rest lightly on your stomach, and your biceps should just barely break the drape of sleeve from shoulder.
Of the many other factors involved in fitting a jacket, the chest and shoulders are the most important and the hardest to alter.
Your shirt should always be tighter than your jacket, lest you end up with clumps of fabric which have no place to go.
The cuffs should protrude ¼”-½” from the jacket’s sleeves when you stand with arms hanging; the collar should cover ½”-1″ of your neck above the jacket collar.
There is of course much more to say about the fit of these and other garments; these points are intended merely to illustrate the basic idea of fit.
Let me note here that buying clothes that fit means buying clothes that fit your body, as it is, and not measuring them to an idealized vision you have of yourself.
Many men, when getting measured for a suit, will stick out their chests and stretch their spines, striving toward some idealized masculine figure. Unless this is how you stand normally, though, this is not how you should be measured. You can round your height up an inch on your driver’s license, but you only hurt yourself by embellishing for your tailor.
Similarly, in certain cultures where weight loss is an obsession, some men succumb to the folly of ‘buying skinny.’ That is, they buy clothes one size too small, anticipating a perfect fit when they lose weight. This is a dangerous proposition, both for one’s bank account and one’s self-esteem, and it is also misguided.
Almost any shirt, sweater, or jacket that fits you well will still fit well if you gain or lose ten pounds. Men’s trousers are the most sensitive, but even these will withstand small fluctuations.
When your waistline does shrink or grow by a half inch or more, they can easily be altered, often several inches in either direction.
Unless you are still going through puberty, you have nothing to gain by selecting clothes which do not fit your body as it is today.
It is a wonderful feeling to don garments that have been tailored to fit you perfectly.
One feels light and comfortable as one’s clothes seem to float around the body, neither heavy nor tight anywhere but rather resting evenly throughout. Clearly, getting such clothes retail is nearly impossible, or more men would do it.
While there may be a suit that fits you perfectly somewhere, your odds of finding it are slim.
Even to build a small wardrobe of decently fitting garments, a man must spend many hours searching through racks and trying things on.
Fortunately, though, custom made tailored clothing can now be had for less than most designer brands. Once he knows his dimensions and has a trusted source, it is simple for a man to acquire professional, formal, and casual clothes alike that fit just right, and he will look grand in all of them."
https://atailoredsuit.com/proper-proportion-mens-clothing.html,"The man who takes care with proportion in his suits and dress shirts always looks good.
Unfortunately, this point is woefully under appreciated today; it’s rare to find a man whose style is understated elegance, the kind of man who people feel is always well dressed without knowing why.
Most men’s suits and dress shirts sold in stores are available in only a few standard sizes and are constructed according to the fashion of their day.
It’s true that with proper tailoring most men can get a reasonable fit out of a retail suit or other garment, but with a suit especially there are so many opportunities for customization that one misses out on a lot when buying off the rack.
In retail, crucial details like gorge height, closure, button stance, and lapel width are dictated by the whims of fashion rather than the needs of a wearer’s unique body.
Most men’s suit and dress shirts are cut for a hypothetical model, a 1 in 100 man who doesn’t exist. Knowing this, it’s no surprise that most menswear does not flatter those of us who are taller, shorter, thinner, or heavier than the model that brand was cut for.
Most of us would do far better having our suit jackets and trousers adjusted, as that the right cuts and proportions can greatly enhance any man’s appearance. The great dressers of our century knew this.
Douglas Fairbanks had his suit jackets’ shoulders built out to offset his large head, while Gary Cooper had his suit’s lapels cut to end in a low gorge, breaking up his height. Just look at modern day examples such as George Clooney and Tom Brady; these men wear suits, dress shirts, and sport jackets that highlight their body’s natural features and strengths.
While it is true that certain bodies clash with certain articles of clothing, by no means does one’s body type confine him to a particular style.
A critical step in dressing well is discovering those clothing proportions that work for your body and then insisting on such proportions in every item you buy.
Under the jacket, the dress shirt has a few rules of its own:
Of course all of these proportion rules are flexible for the man who understands them. In fact most trends in men’s clothing consist of the breaking of these established rules.
Designers bombard the public with images of brutally attractive models striking enviable poses, clad in their latest offerings.
By objective standards, these may be too loose or too tight, excessively short or top-heavy, or otherwise unbalanced.
Models have jobs because they look good in anything; most of us are not so lucky. Trendy designer clothes only look good on us because they evoke the beautiful people on billboards and magazine spreads.
When tastes change, in a few years or a single season, those who paid full price for designer wares at the height of their fleeting glory are left with expensive clothes that, they must now admit, look slightly ridiculous.
How much wiser is the man who buys clothes that are right for him, and wears them confidently knowing his style transcends the pettiness of fashion."

Formality of a Navy Blue Suit
Fabric of a Navy Blue Suit
Fitting the Navy Blue Men’s Suit
Navy Suit Styles
Color and Pattern with a Navy Suit
The Navy Blue Suit in Conclusion
Business offices that still require suits are invariably dominated by two basic colors: charcoal gray and navy blue.
Charcoal gray is the more popular of the two thanks to its offering the same high dress standard with somewhat less color-matching challenges; however both remain enduring classics of men’s style and if a man only own two suits he should have one at least be navy blue.
Navy blue offers unique advantages that earn it a place in most discerning suit-wearers’ closets.
Most strikingly, navy is a “young” color, lending an impression of youthfulness to the wearer that older men may find very flattering (though extremely young or baby-faced men may find the effect too youthful for their tastes).
First-time suit buyers and veteran dressers alike will want to keep the benefits of the navy color in mind as they build their wardrobes.
It’s important to distinguish navy from other blues: a true navy blue suit is a deep, almost midnight color, not just any dark blue. The latter can make striking suits for more casual occasions, but lack the universal acceptance of navy.
Navy blue, on the other hand, can go anywhere. It serves up to “black tie optional” levels of formality when worn with a white shirt and conservative tie.
Worn more casually, particularly if the jacket is worn separately with lighter slacks, a navy suit becomes a piece of social wear suitable for any relaxed occasion.
Note the color midnight navy is its own shade of navy blue, and is best reserved for a unique and classic take on black tie formalwear. 
A patterned suit is always less formal than a plain one; thus a navy pinstripe is an option for a businessman who is going to own more than few suits and want to signal he is ready to make a deal.
Pinstripes are the most common modification in navy suits, and they are acceptable business wear when done modestly.
An unbroken solid navy however will be more versatile, so if you’re going to own one suit and it will be navy blue select a solid that can be used for solemn occasions or the most formal of business dealings.
Navy is a deep, rich color, that looks best in 100% virgin wool fabric. It does well in thick weaves without excess sheen. Too much smoothness to a weave can create a glossy, slick appearance that looks unnatural to the eye.
Thick wool fabrics make excellent navy suits with a matte finish that shows the color off to its advantage.
A lighter wool can keep the garment comfortable in warmer weather and still lends the natural drape of wool, which keeps the fabric even and close to the wearer’s body.
Exotic blends to include cashmere and mohair are desireable if one seeks extra softness and perhaps a lighter weight with similiar properties to wool.
Small percentages of artificial fiber in the weave are acceptable (US law allows a 3% variance – so what is declared 100% wool may actually be 97%), and even desirable in small quantities for strength and stretch resistance.
More than trace however points to cost-saving rather than well-thought construction and fabrics with more than 30% synthetic fiber should be avoided if you can afford it. Too much synthetic fiber in the weave creates a flat, plastic-like sheen that makes a suit look cheap and will cut its life significantly.
Fit matters in every suit, and most of all in a dark suit. A dark suit emphasizes the shape and presence of the wearer more than a lighter color would.
Excess fabric can make a man look slumped and saggy, while fabric that clings or pinches too tightly makes him look awkwardly oversized and straining at the seams. A fit that stays close to the body without pinching while moving is ideal for a dark suit like navy blue.
The shoulders and sides of the jacket and the “rise” of the trousers — the distance between the waistband and the crotch — are the key areas to check in suitfit.
Excess fabric in any of them will look obviously saggy to viewers, and tightness will be exceedingly uncomfortable as well as unattractive.
Men buying off-the-rack should also pay attention to collar size, which tends to be unnecessarily loose on many mass-produced jackets and will most likely need to be adjusted.
The cut and details of a man’s suit depends largely on its intended purpose.
A man who wears suits infrequently and needs a single, multipurpose garment for all dress occasions will want to err on the side of the universally acceptable: a single-breasted, two- or three-button jacket in plain navy is the ideal arrangement.
Businessmen who wear suits daily may want a touch more variety in their wardrobes.
Peaked lapels add an unusual flair to an otherwise traditional jacket, and venting — short slits up the back of the jacket — can help it drape more neatly as the wearer moves. A double-breasted jacket or accompanying waistcoat offer more extreme variation, and give an extremely elegant and formal look to a navy suit.
Dark trousers should ideally sit high on the waist and drape over the front of man’s stomach rather than hugging his hips below it. Suspenders may help with this, providing fixed points for the pants to fall cleanly from rather than a tight belt pinching loose fabric into place. Pleated fronts offer additional room for men with a broader midsection, while slimmer gentlemen can wear a plain-fronted trouser for a more streamlined visual appeal.
Part of a charcoal gray suit‘s enduring popularity stems from the ease of matching other clothing; navy blue requires a touch more thought for a balanced look.
Blue does best contrasted with “warmer” colors — its natural opposites on the color wheel — than it does with close neighbors like purple and green.
Very light shades of these similar colors can still stand out against the darkness of navy green, and patterns will help moderate the effect further, but men will want to be cautious of mixing their blue suit with anything too closely related.
Plain white is, of course, always an option, and the most formal one available.
If a navy suit is worn unpatterned it can serve admirably well with suits and ties of most patterns. A pinstriped suit is more limited, and should only be worn with clothing in patterns of a different scale.
Wide pinstripes will probably look fine with a very closely-gridded dress shirt, for example, but would look awkward over another set of broad stripes.
Navy blue’s position in menswear is well-assured. It shares the highest dress standard outside of formalwear with charcoal gray. Many men prefer gray for its ease of matching, but navy offers a slightly more eye-catching touch of color and a distinctly youthful flavor that flatters older men.
A navy suit can serve as a regular piece of clothing for a frequent suit-wearer or as the single go-to option for a man who rarely needs a full suit. We recommend a navy suit — or several — for any man’s wardrobe."

The Charcoal Gray Suit – Conclusion
The better part of most men’s clothing stores’ suit inventory comes in one color: charcoal gray.
The dark matte gray has become the standard of business dress, and by far the most ubiquitous option.
It is always appropriate, easy to match, and flattering to nearly all complexions; all of which account for its overwhelming popularity.
It also makes charcoal gray almost certain to dominate the male side of any well-dressed social occasion, and therefore one of the hardest colors to stand out uniquely in.
The near-black charcoal is considered the ideal in business formality. Its only competitor is navy blue, another deep hue that offers the same advantages: closeness to the formal black without its tuxedo associations and matching challenges.
Charcoal gray suits can be worn at any level of business or social occasion that is not “black tie.” Plain, unpatterned charcoal gray is the ideal alternative to formalwear at a “black tie optional” event.
Patterning reduces the formality of any color, including dark charcoal gray. A modest pinstriping still leaves a suit adequately formal for most business occasions, however — unbroken charcoal is usually only needed in black tie optional settings, or at particularly somber social occasions such as funerals.
The universal acceptance of charcoal gray suits makes them a popular first suit for young men, or for anyone who wears suits rarely and needs a single, multipurpose garment to meet all their dress clothing needs.
Charcoal gray fabric for suits works best as a matte color — one with minimal shine or smoothness to its appearance.
Too bright a shine tends to make it look artificial or even gaudy and destroys the formality of the garment.
Heavy wool is the ideal material, lending a smooth drape and a natural luster that stands up well to the darkness of the color. Some sheep even give wool in a natural dark gray that allows for the construction of undyed suits.
Lighter wools, especially “ultra-fines” and other extremely smooth weaves, may appear a little too slickly smooth for charcoal suits. Artificial fibers are especially likely to have a reflective sheen that looks ill-suited to the formality of a dark suit.
A small percentage of a man-made fiber in a blend is not necessarily a flaw, and may even add strength and durability, but more than a trace of artificial materials in the fabric is a warning sign. Be cautious of anything suit that has no “drag” when you run a hand over it, or that seems to shine under direct light.
Every suit will look better if it is fitted properly.
Dark suits in particular stand out if the fit is improper; the extra visual “weight” draws attention to the flaws.
No point of the suit should be loose enough to sag under its own weight.
The sides of the jacket and the “drop” between the waist of the trousers and the crotch are the likeliest spots for extra fabric, and should be adjusted before a suit is worn if they appear to hang loosely.
Any point tight enough to make the fabric pinch or wrinkle with movement is also going to stand out unattractively. These flaws will stand out clearly in dark color and quality fabric, so take extra care with the fit of a good charcoal suit.
Other details of fit will depend on the role of the suit. Charcoal is a versatile color — it can be used for elegant double-breasted jackets or for very plain business suits equally effectively. A man buying a single suit for all occasions will want to ear on the side of conservative dress, while someone with many suits to choose from can be more experimental.
For the conservative dresser, a single-breasted, two-button suit in plain gray is the most practical style. A snug (but not overly tight) fit in the trousers and the jacket will give you the timeless look men have worn since the suit became the standard of menswear.
Double venting in the back — two vertical slits — will give the jacket more flexibility and let it shift with the wearer without ruining the drape. An unvented jacket has sharper lines, but tends to bunch up when the wearer moves, making it less of an all-purpose item.
A man with more room for experimentation may want to choose styles that will make his suit stand out. Since charcoal gray is a ubiquitous color, a unique cut can go a long way to making a man look unique even when formality restricts his options.
Changing the common notched lapels for peaked adds distinction to a jacket without breaking too far from the standard single-breasted model. A double-breasted jacket or a vested suit adds a unique elegance, and can stand up to a subdued pattern like pinstriping without losing formality.
Of the two, the vested may be the more flexible — a vest can always be omitted to create a basic single-breasted suit, but a double-breasted jacket is always a formal garment.
Any shade of gray is theoretically a neutral color — it has no opposite on the color wheel.
There are no automatic “clashes” with gray, which accounts for a large part of its popularity. The neutral base removes the suit from the equation of matching or contrasting colors.
It is still possible to make poor color choices with a gray suit. Against a neutral background, the brightness of the hues becomes as important as the individual color chosen.
Anything too dark will look like an attempted but failed match, while anything extremely vibrant will look garish against the somber gray. Pastel shirts do well with charcoal, as do white-dominant patterns that break up the base color of the shirt.
A plain white shirt with a charcoal suit is an exceedingly formal look, and should be reserved for the most somber or serious of occasions. A tie is a must at that level of formality, and should be conservatively patterned with no bright colors or sharp contrasts.
If a man needs to own a suit, one in charcoal gray is likely to be the best choice. The only real equivalent is a navy blue suit, which fills the same basic function. Men who wear suits regularly can even find utility in multiple charcoal suits of differing cuts.
A high-formality suit with a double-breasted jacket or a vest can be worn to stand out, and a simple two-button jacket can serve when a more conservative appearance is called for. With the flexibility it affords, a charcoal suit — or several — is a piece of menswear that everyone can find a use for.

https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-suit-introduction.html,"The men’s suit is, without question, the most universal and steadfastly appropriate item in a gentleman’s wardrobe.
There are few occasions at which a man in a quality suit will be out of place, particularly if the wearer has a firm grasp of fashion and an established personal style.
The path to elegant style begins with the suit, the cornerstone of men’s fashion.
The first thing to make clear, before diving into cuts and suit fabrics and pocket flaps, is that the rules of men’s style are guidelines gleaned across the decades from what has stood the test of time, and what generally flatters a given figure.
These style rules serve as a guide to what will enhance ones features, but they are only a guide.
The first and foremost rule of men’s style is never wear clothing that you cannot wear confidently.
Confidence is an essential element of making any ensemble work, and garments that inhibit confidence do more to damage one’s appearance than any perceived enhancement can outweigh.
This rule does not, however, provide free reign to wear whatever one wishes and declare it stylish because it is comfortable.
It is merely a reminder that if one feels more comfortable in a style different than the guidelines given here would suggest, careful thought should be given to whether to follow the guideline or choose the more comfortable style.
At its most basic, a men’s suit is a jacket and trousers of the same cut, made from the same material, and intended to be worn together.
Such a simple definition, however, denies much of the suit’s personality, and it is that personality that has made the suit a lasting and essential element of a gentleman’s outfitting. The primary element of a suit is its jacket, so our discussion will begin there.
Men’s suit jackets
are defined by many things: the fabric from which they are made, including its color and weight; the style or cut of the suit; the details or trimming applied; the degree of customization to its wearer, etc.
Of these, the cut is paramount – a poorly cut suit will never look right on the wearer, regardless of the quality or detailing.
The cut of a suit is a product of two elements: the overall silhouette and the particular proportions of the man who will be wearing it.
A good tailor will cut a suit to flatter the wearer’s best features and diminish any flaws, which is perhaps the best argument for having one’s suits custom tailored.
There are three major styles of suit, named for the countries in which they originated, though it is now quite common to find all three styles in any country, as well as fusions of elements from one or more different styles.
The first is the English style, typified by soft, unpadded shoulders, a long, hourglass body with a high waist, either double or single breasted, with two or three buttons and side vents.
The second is the Italian, or sometimes Continental style, epitomized by a lightweight construction, squared, high shoulders, a short, close-fitting, single-breasted body, with two buttons and no vent.
Rounding out the group is the American or sack suit, a natural-shoulder suit with a straight and somewhat roomier body, three-buttons and a back vent.
Assuming equality of cut, a custom-made or bespoke men’s suit will flatter more than an altered or made-to-measure suit, which in turn will have a better fit than an unaltered or off the rack suit.
Bespoke suits are custom-tailored to a gentleman’s measurements and built by hand by a master tailor.
Made-to-measure suits are off-the-rack suits that have been fitted and altered to the wearer’s frame, though they can only be altered to a point, and will never fit as well as one custom built.
Off the rack suits, as the name suggests, have no alterations, and because they are made to an average specification, will not conform to many if any of the wearer’s particulars.
After cut and customization, suit fabric is the next consideration.
While the difference in quality between an off the rack and bespoke suit is imminently obvious, both can appear quite stylish; that is not the case with poor quality fabric, which can make even the most expensive custom suit appear cheap.
The most traditional fabric for a suit is wool, with a dizzying array of colors and weights to choose from.
Suits, particularly for summer, are also available in silk, cotton and gabardine, as well as linen – a traditional favorite not without its own unique challenges – and even mohair and cashmere.
There is also the tweed suit, a rugged classic best suited to weekends in the country; its thick, coarse fabric is designed to repel wind and water in the often quite chilly English countryside, and would be out-of-place at a social function in the city.
The choice of a suit’s color is an equally important decision, and one best addressed in a separate discussion.
Perhaps the final indicator of quality is the suit’s trimming, the selection of its details. Options include pocket styles, linings, button materials, and the addition of subtle signals of the suit’s quality such as ticket pockets and functional sleeve buttons.
These little elements, though they may seem extraneous, are signs of the suit’s personality, as well as the wearer’s. Good details won’t make a poor suit into a quality one, but they do elevate suits at every quality level from the ordinary to the individual.
There is much more to know about the suit, and far more depth to what has already been discussed. For those ready to dive into the world of cuts, fabrics, fittings, and fixtures, The Men’s Suit: The Jacket In Detail awaits."
https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-jewlery-tailored-suit.html,"For a man wearing a suit, the right jewelry can upgrade your look from smart to brilliant.
At the same time, ostentatious ‘bling-bling’ is distracting and unattractive.
Men’s jewelry should always be subtle.
This article is going to help clear up one of the most often discussed topic in men’s style.
What jewelry is suitable for the modern man and what is not.
While a critical question, it also matters when to wear your accessories as too much can become tacky.
This article will dive in to the types of jewelry suitable for the modern man.
There is nothing more appropriate to your outfit to help bring out your character than with jewelry.
The watch is often a suitable piece of jewelry for men by virtue of its functionality; cufflinks and tie clips earn provisional legitimacy on the same grounds.
The wedding band is respected for what it represents, and other rings may be subtle enough to work to a man’s advantage in the right setting.
Piercings have featured prominently in so many counter-culture movements, from pirates to camp to punk rock, that they immediately arouse negative reactions from many.
If you are going to wear an eyebrow stud with a suit, the suit had better fit you like your own skin if you don’t want to be remembered as ‘the guy with the eyebrow ring.’
A general rule of dressing says to match metal to metal. That means that if your belt buckle is silver, for instance, so should be your cuff links, tie clip, and anything else shiny you wear.
As with all things, this is a general guideline, not a hard and fast rule: a man with a gold wedding ring can wear silver cuff links if he likes, and one who wears an heirloom silver watch is free to wear brass buckles.
Another rule says not to wear gold after dark (nor button-down collars, nor brown shoes, for that matter). This is good to keep in mind when dressing for the night-life, and again, it is a good suggestion rather than a cardinal law.
The watch is one of those elements of dress by which some people will choose to define you.
The gaudy, bejeweled timepieces that bulge from the French cuffs of investment bankers certainly have their place, as do the thin, un-numbered dress watches seen on gallery curators’ wrists.
Some men have a treasured timepiece that they wear exclusively for decades; others own several watches, for different occasions or simply for day-to-day variety. The latter requires more effort for the American man, though, who must reset all his clocks twice a year, and for men whose work or fancy require them to know the time to the exact second.
As with most things, the simpler a watch, the more formal.
When one dons a tuxedo or tailcoat, tradition decrees that one not wear a watch at all, as keeping track of time isn’t something we associate with partying.
Those few whose professions still demand rigid formality in dress, such as politicians and trial lawyers, ought to wear classy timepieces free of jewels, moving bezels, excess dials, and the like.
Gold and silver are equally suitable, as are metal and leather bands. For those whose positions grant more flexibility, any decent watch will do; take advantage of this opportunity for personal expression and find something that’s really you.
When you choose to wear French cuffs on a dress shirt, you have the opportunity to wear cufflinks.
Cufflinks come in many styles, of gold, silver, gunmetal, and brass, with all variety of precious stones and other embellishments.
When you select them for purchase or wear, know that people will examine them closely and make a decision about the wearer based on them – are they bold, classic, gaudy, or novel – and more importantly, do you want to be perceived as this.
Really think about what they say about you, and make sure it aligns with how you seek to present yourself.
Our advice is to stay with simple classic designs or with cufflinks that have some type of sentimental value; avoid the diamond studded pink Playboy rabbit links unless you are Hugh Hefner.
A tie clip will keep your tie from flying over your shoulder on a windy street while evoking an on-the-go lifestyle that requires such assistance.
A simple stripe of gold, silver, or some other metal is acceptably classy; anything more appears gaudy.
Tie clips look best worn at an angle to counteract the rigidity they connote for some.
A tie chain works much the same as a tie clip, but instead of a fixed bar holding your tie in place you have a drooping chain of silver or gold.
Lastly there is the tie tack; it looks something like a stud earring with an inch of fine chain extending from the back.
One sticks it through the center of the tie and then attaches the chain to a button hole. Since it requires poking a hole in the tie and thus damaging it, we do not recommend its usage.
Unlike other pieces of jewelry, a man does not have a rotation of wedding rings to be coordinated with the day’s other jewelry.
A man should be advised that a plain band, of gold, silver, or platinum, is the most stylish choice available.
If you are already married and have something more ostentatious on your finger, do not fret, few people notice it and no one will think less of you for it.
Besides a wedding ring, other rings of symbolic value may have a place on the well dressed hand. A class or fraternal ring is seen on many stylish men’s hands.
Rings worn entirely for their own sake are somewhat dubious however, since most contemporary societies frown upon such blatant displays of wealth.
If you are in a position where looking rich works to your advantage, though, a ring embedded with precious stones can accomplish this within the boundaries of professional attire.

The Square Handkerchief Fold
The Flute or Puff Handkerchief Fold
Two Point Handkerchief Fold
Pocket Square Folding Conclusion
The art of the dress handkerchief doesn’t end with selecting color, pattern, and fabric.
Equally important is the way in which the pocket square is worn.
A quality pocket square can appear unbecoming if it is improperly handled and haphazardly stuffed into the pocket.
That isn’t to say that the handkerchief must appear excessively arranged. Many of the finest pocket square examples have a casual, fluff-like appearance.
All well worn pocket handkerchiefs, however, have one thing in common: the wearer knew what he wanted, arranged the handkerchief so, and then wore it as a subtle display of his fashion prowess.
Dress handkerchiefs can be arranged in an infinite variety of ways; for simplicity’s sake only the three basic types of pocket square folds are covered here: squared, fluted, and pointed.
The square handkerchief pocket fold, sometimes called the Presidential or the TV fold, is the simplest and most understated of the folds.
In modern times, it is also one of the least often seen.
This fold is very similar to the standard pocket square fold of the for-use handkerchief, except that it must be somewhat longer and narrower in order to fit into the pocket and remain visible.
The precise length and width will depend on the pocket in question as well as the wearer’s preference, but it is generally in the area of 5″ – 6″ long and 3″ – 3½” wide.
If the handkerchief is made of linen or cotton, it should be lightly starched to provide a crisp look; if it is made of silk, it should not be starched, but should be folded so the hand-rolled edges are visible.
Square Handkerchief Fold Step 1 – To create a pocket square fold, one starts with the handkerchief completely unfolded on a flat surface. Begin by folding it in half so that it is now the same width but half the length. Be sure to crease the edge of the handkerchief fold, and each fold to come.
Square Handkerchief Fold Step 2 – Next, fold in half again, so that it once again becomes a square, one-fourth of its original size.
Square Handkerchief Fold Step 3 – Finally, fold in half one more time, so it becomes half as wide as it is long. This is then inserted into the jacket pocket with between ½” and 1″ of the handkerchief visible.
The finished product can be inserted in many different ways: tilted diagonally is a popular style. Such details are up to the wearer, and it is best to try several options at first to find ones preference.
The next style is the flute, sometimes called the balloon or puff handkerchief fold. This style is quite possibly the easiest to create, but the hardest to perfect. It is the least casual of all the pocket square folds, as it literally looks like you nonchalantly threw it into your pocket.
However, this bit of sprezzatura is a planned combination of elegance, grace, and practice.
Flute, Balloon, Puff Handkerchief Fold Part 1 – With the handkerchief open and on a flat surface, pinch it from the middle and lift it up.
Flute, Balloon, Puff Handkerchief Fold Part 2 – With the other hand, create a ring with the thumb and index finger around the top of the handkerchief, right below the pinch, and pull downwards, forming a column or “flute”.
Flute, Balloon, Puff Handkerchief Fold Part 3 – Fold so that about half of the fabric is on the “flute” end, half on the “point” end, and tuck into the pocket, so that 1″ to 1½” remains visible.
If necessary, adjust to fill the width of the pocket; should the flute be too tall or too short, re-flute, folding as needed to achieve the desired size.
The final style, the two point, is the opposite of the flute handkerchief fold in terms of careful folding, planning, and formality. It is best you use a starched or well ironed cotton or linen pocket square for this particular fold, although with care and practice an attractive two point pocket two point look can be achieved with a silk handkerchief.
In these photos, we will be showing you how to create a two point pocket handkerchief fold. There are many variations; this one is appropriate for conservative settings and is just a tad flashier than the square pocket fold.
Two Point Handkerchief Fold Step 1 – To create a two point handkerchief fold starts with the handkerchief unfolded on a flat table. Fold the pocket square in half, and then fold it again in half lengthwise so that you have a smaller square 1/4 the original handkerchief size. Now slightly slide the top 1/2 to the left or right – these are your points, so the amount to separate them is up to your tastes.
Two Point Handkerchief Fold Step 2 – Now start folding the right, left, and bottom corners in so they meet at the middle pf the square. This will be hidden from view, so do not worry about pressing these folds.
Two Point Handkerchief Fold Step 3 – Finally, adjust the bottom handkerchief folds as necessary to fill the width of the pocket and to keep the points from clustering too tightly. Place in your breast pocket and adjust.
Each fold has its own distinct personality, conveying different messages about the wearer to those he meets. The best approach to finding one’s preferred style is to try different variations and choose the pocket square fold that best complements your personal style."

A lot of you all ask me what I read when I’m not writing or reading about men’s style.
So here is a short list of some of my favorite websites!
Good Financial Cents – Jeff Rose is an Army combat vet, father, husband, and savvy money manager. He first came to my attention when he guest posted over at the Art of Manliness, and has stayed on my radar because he continues to give solid information about an industry that is confusing to most men. Although I don’t invest with Jeff – I have a college friend in Colorado I use – I think his library of financial articles is solid and well worth your time studying. Also he’s a St Louis Cardinal’s fan.

Must-read for anyone starting his/her own business and super important even if you think your business is doing well. I’m a premium member and think it’s the best membership site on the internet. I can’t recommend Andrew’s site enough!
The Rise to the Top – Video interviews with successful businessmen and entrepreneurs, DSG focuses on people who have made their successes (legitimately) online. DSG’s interview style is a bit different, as he likes to have conversations, but don’t let that fool you. The content here is solid and he should be charging for it! So grab it while it’s free.
ReelSEO – This is where I go for my video fix – the guys over at Reel SEO are my video consulting team who keep me abreast of the latest and greatest when it pertains to online video.
The Workout Corner – A man’s body is the vessel through which he travels throughout life. If he takes care of it – it reflects in other aspects of his life and enables him to succeed because he can think clearly, avoid illness and injury, and signal to others he is healthy.

https://atailoredsuit.com/conceal-carry-tips.html,"There are many challenges a man faces when carrying a concealed firearm while wearing a suit, sport jacket, or blazer.
We’ll discuss how to overcome them by having a suit made or adjusted to ensure your weapon is truly hidden.
If you’ve decided to wear a concealed firearm with a suit, always employ the services of a competent tailor who is familiar with the requirements of concealed carry.
Whether he makes a suit for you or adjusts your existing sport jacket, the right experience and expertise makes all the difference.
Here are 10 tricks we employ to ensure a proper conceal carry:
1. Take your measurements with your firearm – when working with a new tailor, be upfront that you are carrying a concealed weapon before he measures you.
Some clothiers may have an issue, and it’s best to be transparent before you find yourself in an awkward situation.
2. Add an extra layer of lining or canvas to the bottom 12 inches of jacket; this will increase the stiffness and as mentioned reduce printing.
Extra fabric to prevent printing of a concealed carry firearm can be added after the fact, but it is best if it’s designed and woven into a custom jacket or suit where you have full control.
3. Add an extra ½ to 1 inch of length to the jacket (depending on your height) – this extra length will help ensure when you raise your arms you do not reveal that you are carrying a holstered firearm.
4. Make sure to have small arm holes to minimize the rise of the jacket when raising ones arms; this is related to the above point, but is separate as it cannot be altered and should be paid attention to when the jacket is purchased .
Custom jackets and suits should be made standard with this feature.
5. Have small weights sewn into your jacket lining at the font bottom corners of your jacket, and ensure the corners are more square than rounded.
This added weight and shape with extra fabric will help prevent you from flashing to the world you conceal carry.
Another option is to turn the jacket’s corners into small pockets where you can store a heavy coin such as a silver dollar or commemorative coin.
6. Select dark colored fabrics for your suits, sport jackets, and trousers; also patterns that break up lines such as herringbone, nailhead, and birdseye work well.
Avoid pin stripes on a suit – they accentuate a bulge in the fabric and should never be worn when you look to conceal a firearm.
Also avoid mixing light colored trousers with a dark suit – this draws the eye to the midsection where you may be carrying your weapon.
7. Consider stiff & heavy fabrics such as cotton, flannels, and winter weight wools. These naturally resist printing and require little if any of the specialty adjustments we discussed. Unfortunately they only look natural in cool weather areas.
8. Wear a matching dark colored vest. This eliminates the stark contrast between the light colored shirt and your firearm and if worn under your jacket enables you to take your coat off without startling your office mates.
Few suit vests can properly conceal a gun, so this is a supplemental item and does not substitute for a jacket.
Wearing both a jacket and vest over your concealed weapon should be avoided if possible as it makes it harder to reach you weapon.
9. Sew in a plastic rod or zip strap like piece along the jacket’s front openings. This stiffens the fabric edge and enables you to easily flip it out of the way for a quicker draw.
10. Consider a sartorial distraction such as a pocket square or boutonniere. A man wearing a flower in his lapel is less likely to be suspected of carrying a weapon by a casual observer.
Nevertheless, this trick calls attention to the wearer, so it is only advised if the wearer is otherwise the center of attention, such as when delivering a speech.
Like any magician will tell you, the key is to direct your audience’s attention on what you want them to focus on."
https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-pocket-squares-intro.html,"Of all the various accessories available to the gentleman, the handkerchief in the jacket’s breast pocket is quite likely the least understood.
What color to choose, which fabric is right, and how to fold it properly are just some of the questions that add to the apprehension.
The dress handkerchief doesn’t have to be a mysterious and frightening item; with a little know-how and a few simple rules, it can become a standard – and debonair – part of any gentleman’s wardrobe.
The cardinal rule of dress handkerchiefs – or pocket squares, as they’re often called – is that the handkerchief is never identical to the tie.
The patterned, silky squares that come attached to ties should be ignored outright – they’re there for convenience, not style.
A dress handkerchief is intended as an accessory that brings a bit of contrast and attention to a suit, and that can’t happen when it is perfectly-matched.
Even worse, it tends to make the ensemble look like a package special, which is never what the well-dressed man is looking for.
What you should strive for is a pocket handkerchief that perfectly compliments your outfit; like a well placed garnish, it should only add to the presentation and never overpower or take away.
One never uses a dress handkerchief for anything but show. Instead, carry a plain white cotton handkerchief in your trouser back pocket for general use.
Just as a gentleman wouldn’t think of using his tie to cover his nose, or using his jacket to mop up a spill, so likewise he does not use his dress handkerchief for such tasks.
A secondary benefit of having a handkerchief for regular use is the aristocratic impression it tends to convey.
It is a lost art to see a man provide a clean white handkerchief to a lady who is suddenly overcome with emotion or other distress. One quick note: insist that the lady retain the handkerchief after she has recovered.
A warning: many retailers offer small squares of cardboard with fabric attached, intended to imitate the look of a square without actually learning to fold it.
These are like pre-tied bow-ties and clip-on neckties: shortcuts that any stylish gentleman should avoid.
One of the greatest benefits of learning to dress elegantly is the control it affords over one’s attire, control that clip-on ties and cardboard squares can never provide.
The options for dress handkerchiefs are endless: a wide number of fabrics from which to choose, an infinite array of colors and patterns, and a world of origami-like folds await the gentleman who decides to adopt it.
The dress handkerchief is an elegant touch brought to a well-crafted ensemble, and a symbol of the confidence in ones own style, displayed for the world to see."
https://atailoredsuit.com/matching-a-tie.html,"The right men’s tie can be the polish that gives an outfit the perfect shine.
But with an infinite number of colors, patterns, and fabrics to choose from the gentleman can be left with a difficult choice of which one to choose.
For many men, the solution is to avoid variety and stick with a small collection of solid colored or simple striped ties.
While there is nothing wrong with conservative solids and stripes, the multitude of options available makes a strong case for injecting some variety into the wardrobe.
The Solid Tie
Looking at color and pattern options, the most basic is the solid. A solid tie is easiest to match; one simply selects a tie that coordinates with one of the colors in the suit or shirt.
However, within this simplicity lies the danger of over coordination, the faux pas of looking too matched or having put to much time into the outfit.
Avoid a blue tie and blue shirt with a navy blue suit; combinations such as this often look forced. Instead think of the tie as your chance to interject something new and exciting.
The Striped Tie
Equally classic is the men’s stripe tie, which is easily matched with solid suits and shirts by selecting a stripe that complements.
In the case of a patterned jacket, shirt, or both, the key is to maintain colors that complement and attend to diversity of scale.
A finely pinstriped suit calls for a boldly striped tie, while a strong checked shirt would be better suited by a more subdued stripe.
One note of caution about striped ties: Like the various Scottish tartans, in the United Kingdom, certain stripe patterns signify membership in a particular group, particularly military units, universities, and gentlemen’s clubs.
When interacting with business contacts in the UK, it is good practice to check with a knowledgeable party that ones tie does not bear the stripe of a group or association.
The Plaid Tie
Harder to find, this choice of neckwear is a great way to embolden an otherwise plain outfit.
Creating the illusion of dimension, this tie will draw attention to itself so do not pair it with an overpowering shirt. Look to pair this tie with solid colored suits and shirts.
Dots, Paisley, and Figure Ties
Polka dots, paisley, and figure – meaning small repeating images such as a university/club/military crest – have become much more common over the years.
If kept in good taste, avoiding flamboyant colors and designs, these ties can liven up any solid or striped suit.
Such ties are matched to an ensemble by their primary color, with attention paid to avoiding secondary colors that visibly clash with the shirt and suit.
As before, when the shirt, suit, or both are also patterned, the key is to maintain a difference in scale between the patterns.
Men’s Tie Construction
Always look for quality material and good construction when choosing a tie, and avoid anything that appears poorly crafted. The most common material in ties construction is silk, and for most it is considered the gold standard.
Beware of cheap polyester impostors; polyester doesn’t possess the same drape as silk, and tends to bear a high sheen that leaves an impression of poor quality.
With some attention to detail and an eye towards elegance, a gentleman can quickly become a master at selecting the perfect tie to complete his carefully chosen ensemble.
While the solid silk option is a safe and classic choice, one should not be afraid to venture into the world of bolder patterns and textured fabrics.
It is this sort of confident stylistic venture that sets the gentleman’s wardrobe apart from that of the uninitiated."
https://atailoredsuit.com/how-to-match-tie.html,"Introduction to Matching Necktie and Dress Shirt Color & Patterns
One of the most frustrating issues a man faces as he completes his look is coordinating his tie with the rest of his clothing.
There is much confusion on the subject of matching a tie with a dress shirt as there are few rules and an endless number of variable in the equation.
This article is meant to be a guide, not a list of steadfast matching rules.
No article can predict the unlimited combinations and occasions men across the world face when dressing themselves.
With that being said, if nothing else remember to keep it simple, seek to coordinate but do not be afraid to clash, and do the work beforehand to ensure your ties and dress shirts are timelessly classic to begin with thus making the exercise much easier to begin with.
Solid and semi-solid colored ties are the easiest ties to match to a man’s shirt and suit.
The lack of pattern enables it to simply compliment his other articles of clothing.
A solid burgundy necktie can serve perfectly as the finishing touch for a check shirt and navy pin-striped suit or go just as well with the more formal light blue dress shirt and plain charcoal suit look.
The smoother and shinier the silk on the tie, the more formal it will appear (assuming it is a non-flashy color).
For a more casual look consider solid cotton or wool neckties – on average less formal than silk, their non-reflective surface ensure a more subtle look.
Ties that display multiple narrow stripes in many different colors are common for contemporary Italian design ties.
When matching such a tie, as the one displayed on the left, make sure that the patterns and colors harmonize with the rest of your outfit.
Because this tie already displays hint of purple it will look great on top of a color that is in the same family.
A light rose-pink or light lavender color dress shirt is a perfect example. Next, have a look at the other colors on this tie. The stripes are black, tan, and brown.
Every time a tie shows brown it will look better with a navy-blue, tan, beige, or olive colored suit than it would with gray, charcoal, or black suit.
If you would like to combine this tie with other fabric patterns, make sure to choose a pattern that is larger in size. A great example is a midnight blue suit with wider spaced Prince of Wales check pattern.
A classic striping pattern is defined by a simple design in two contrasting colors. The cherry-red and bright white striped tie on the left is a perfect example.
Because the stripes are spaced wide apart this tie will look great on top of a narrow striped or finely checkered pattern dress shirt. Almost any suit color will compliment this tie and dress shirts in blue and white are best.
The “candy-cane” striped pattern of this tie may not be welcome in any office environment.
The bright white with red combination may be perceived as too loud and flashy by some. It is therefore not a good tie to wear to a job interview or when trying to make a good first professional impression.
Special  Note –  If you are wearing an authentic military regiment tie you should have served in the unit or have the right to wear it.  I know of more than a few instances where a man has been confronted by a member of the unit whose tie he is sporting.  
Traditional British ties are recognized by their slightly conservative striped design, dull colors, and fine ribbed fabric weave.
These neckties typically have their stripes fall from right to left (when looking at the tie head-on), although the North American military tie variant falls from left to right, with some saying the reason being to simply confound our brethren on the other side of the pond.
Classic colors are burgundy, amber, olive, forest green, navy, and tan.
Traditional British ties are often made from stiffer fabric blends, either cotton or fine wool with delicate silk. The tie on the left is a perfect example. The burgundy red and amber-yellow color combines best with a medium-blue or white dress shirt.
Also great are narrow striped dress shirts, dress shirts with button down collar, and shirts made from oxford cloth. Besides the classic 2-piece suit, British striped ties also look great in combination with dress pants and contrasting blazer jacket.
The slightly rougher look of the ribbed fabric compliments coarser fabrics such as an oxford dress shirt and tweed sport jackets. The best necktie knot for these ties is the slightly asymmetrically shaped Four in Hand knot.
The Paisley pattern is a tear-drop like shape that originated in Persia during the 16th century.
It is said that the paisley is derived from the shape of the shoots of a young date palm – a symbol of fertility in ancient Babylonia and the Hindu religion.
The paisley was a major textile motif in Persia and was used to decorate royal and religious garments. During the 1960s the paisley pattern became popular on men’s ties and has resurfaced every few years since.
Most recently the paisley pattern has become smaller, almost polka dot-like size.
The most popular polka dot, foulard, and club ties have very small and intricate patterns that are either screen-printed onto or jacquard woven into the fabric.
When combining these ties with a shirt and suit, the same principle of combining patterns applies: each clothing item’s pattern should be different in size and preferably also have a different shape.
This cherry-red and white polka dot tie combines well with a blue and white checkered shirt and solid gray suit.
The delicate design in combination with the brilliant shine of the silk fabric makes this tie better suited for an elegant 2-piece suit rather than a blazer or sport coat jacket."
https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-shirt-cuffs.html,"The shirt cuffs are a small but very important part of a gentleman’s ensemble; besides the collar, they are one of the only visible parts of a shirt when a jacket is worn.
Shirt cuffs should extend one inch past the jacket sleeves, and they can provide a polished look to ones ensemble.
In this article we will talk about two of the most common types of cuffs; Button and French cuffs.
Button cuffs are single cuffs, which wrap around the arm and are buttoned into place.
The most common button cuffs have a single button or may be adjustable, with two buttons side-by-side. These are the cuffs most commonly found on ready made shirts.
In custom shirt circles you’ll find dress shirt cuffs with two buttonholes and two vertical buttons, a more formal option often called the barrel cuff.
Button cuffs may also have a small button on the sleeve between the cuff and the end of the cuff opening.
Called the gauntlet button, this smaller button is intended to prevent the area from opening and exposing the gentleman’s wrist.
Gauntlet buttons are a sign of a quality made shirt, a small detail ignored by most off the rack manufacturers.
French cuffs are the most formal cuff option, yet are perfectly appropriate for daily wear in many industries.
The French cuff is a double cuff, folded back and fastened with cufflinks to create a distinctive and distinguished appearance.
Cufflinks must always be worn with French cuffs – though there are more subtle options available, such as fabric knots – so the gentleman must be prepared to keep a reasonable selection on hand.
French cuffs are not made to be rolled up; throw in the phenomenon of cufflinks being prone to disappear, and the French cuff becomes a less attractive option to low maintenance men.-
The choice of ones cuff type is a very important detail and should be chosen with the intended use of the shirt in mind.
Though not everyone requires a closet full of French cuffed shirts, a gentleman should have at least one for those occasions when he wants to appear just a bit more stylish than the ordinary.
Embracing this elegant look is an excellent way to declare to all observers that one not only takes pride in his appearance, but also has an appreciation for subtle elegance."
https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-shirt-collars.html,"Men’s dress shirt collars come in all different colors, sizes, and styles. However, one thing holds true for all of them: They are the frame for the face.
Regardless of the type of suit jacket or tie, ones shirt collar is always visible, and plays a major role in determining how the wearer’s face will appear to observers.
Choosing the right shirt collar will ensure you enhance your facial strengths while downplaying any irregularities.
Collars come in a variety of individual styles, though there are two main types: Turndown collars and wing collars.
Turndown Collars
Turndown collars are the staple found on gentlemen’s shirts, and offer the most opportunity for individual taste. These collars, as the name suggests, are turned down, forming a sort of triangle whose angles vary with the particular look one is aiming for.
Although there are countless variations, the turndown collar comes in two main categories: the point and the cutaway.

Point Collar
The point collar is the most common collar style, where the collar is cut so that the “points” are reasonably close together, sometimes to the extent that they almost hide the top portion of a tie.
Longer, more closely set points tend to draw the eye down towards the tie and away from the face, while a more moderate cut frames the tie and completes the arrow effect pointing at the face.
Cutaway or Spread Collar
The second popular style is the cutaway, or spread collar.
These collars have the points “cut away” or spread – thus the name – revealing more of the upper shirt area and leaving additional room for larger knots such as the Windsor.
Like the point, spread collars come in a variety of widths, with more moderate ones resembling slightly flared point collars, while more extreme versions can be nearly horizontal.
The particular dimensions are best left to the wearer’s preference and body type, with very wide spreads tending to accentuate wider figures while creating a more fully proportioned look on thin gentlemen.

Button Down Collars
The button-down collar style is most often seen on more casual shirts.
These collars have small buttonholes at the very tip of each point, corresponding to a small button on each side of the shirtfront.
While this collar can be worn successfully with a tie, it is the least formal of all the collar choices and is an excellent choice for the man looking to leave the tie behind.
The buttons on the collar, however, are always fastened; to appear with undone collar buttons would be a faux pas.
Pin and Tab Collars
It is also worth mentioning two lesser known collars, which although neglected by many ready made shirt manufactures, are none the less still popular with dandies in the know.
The first is the Pin collar: this collar has small holes in each point, allowing the insertion of a decorative pin or bar behind the tie knot, which thrusts the tie knot forward and up while adding extra decoration to the collar itself. The second, the Tab collar, employs a small tab extending from the middle of each point, which is fixed together – usually with a hook-and-loop closure – behind the tie.
Like the pin collar, this forces the tie forward and up, creating the “standing” look of more elaborate knots. Neither the pin or tab collar should be worn without a tie; the empty holes and flapping tabs present an untidy appearance.
Wing Collars
Familiar to most as the collar frequently worn with the tuxedo – consists of a short shirt collar with no turndown, and two small “wings” at the front which are tucked behind the bow-tie.
These collars are reserved for formalwear, and the gentleman need not give them particular consideration unless morning or evening dress is required.
The choice of dress shirt collar style is a matter of personal preference that a gentleman must determine for himself. There are guidelines, but the rules are not so rigid that one can’t experiment to see what looks best.
When having shirts custom made, remember that all of these collars can be cut at angles and lengths that best frame your features. Once you have accomplished this, you can walk with the confidence accorded to the well dressed man."
https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-shirt-fabrics.html,"Shirt fabrics, or “shirtings” as they are called by tailors, are of various nature and variously appropriate. Cotton is by far the most common fabric for dress shirts, and most fabric names refer to a particular method of weaving it.
The numbers sometimes listed with fabrics denote the thickness of the yarn from which the fabric is made; higher numbers mean thinner yarn, and thence finer cloth and higher prices.
Oxford cloth, the coarsest shirting, is nonetheless quite soft and comfortable. A more casual fabric, its most natural form is the button-down collar.
In colored and patterned Oxford shirts, only the threads running in one direction are dyed, while the others are left white.
This gives the fabric its characteristic textured appearance.
Poplin bears a smoother texture but similar weight, the result of a fine yarn running one way with a thicker one interweaving it.
It is soft and comfortable, and often used in more casual shirts.
Colors find themselves easily at home here, and it takes sporty patterns especially well.
Cotton twill, a shimmery diagonal weave, makes for richly textured shirts without sacrificing formality.
In herringbone twill, the direction of the diagonals switches back and forth every quarter inch or so, giving the fabric even more depth. When occasion or whim calls for a solid shirt, twill plays the role with panache.
Finer still is broadcloth, of fine yarn woven so tightly that it gleams. This is the most formal shirting for day-to-day wear.
End-on-end broadcloth is that made by interweaving threads of alternating colors for a visual texture so subtle it appears solid from an arm’s length away.
Thanks to its tight weave, this cloth displays patterns with exquisite precision.
Formal shirts are made of white piqué cotton, which boasts a rich, woven texture. This is the only shirt proper for black tie or white tie, and it is not appropriate for anything else.
Besides pure cotton, all the fabrics above can be found in cotton/polyester blends. These are less expensive, and while they do not look as rich or feel as smooth, they can often be worn without ironing.
No-iron 100% cotton shirts offer the rich look of natural fiber with the ease of synthetics, but the good ones are very expensive and the cheap ones irritate the skin.
Synthetics fibers get itchy and uncomfortable in extreme heat, i.e. over 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Ironing is really not that much work, and it is the surest way to look and feel good in shirts which are affordable enough that you can stock your closet with a diverse collection of them."
https://atailoredsuit.com/understanding-contrast-shirt-color-selection.html,"The first thing a person notices about a man’s dress shirt is its color.
In a crowded room of men in suits, your choice of dress shirt color will either help you stand out or blend in.
Neither of which is a bad thing.
Rather, the key here is what are your intentions and do you know how to mix and match your clothing in order to fulfill them.
The only way to do this is to gain mastery in understanding what colors complement you.
A man’s complexion, hair color, and eye color are the key indicators he should use when selecting the color of a fabric which will cover his body.
Unfortunately, most men make their color decision based on what they have worn in the past, what colors are readily available, and the ever-changing winds of fashion.
The result is what you see today at most networking events; a sea of solid white and blue dress shirts.
The two most important factors in selecting dress shirt color are a man’s skin tone and hair color.
Eye color is a wild-card factor; in the cases where eye color strongly contrasts a man’s complexion and hair color, it can be used to introduce colors that would otherwise not complement an individual. It is the relationship between these three factors that determines what contrast category a man falls into:
I will break these down further for you below.
These are men whose hair color is a stark contrast to their skin tone; black hair with white skin is a perfect example.
For high contrast men the key to looking good is to be able to mimic this color difference in their clothing with the contrast in their facial zone.
A dark navy blue suit with a white dress shirt or a charcoal grey suit matched with an ice blue dress shirt are two combinations that complement high contrast men.
Dark shirts with light suits, such as a light grey suit with a french blue dress shirt, is an option but requires confidence and warm weather.
High contrast men are always complemented by strong ties that stand out from the shirt.
As the name suggests, these are men with a muted appearance.
Light hair and light skin is the most common variant, but men with red hair, bald men, and men with little hair also fall into this category.
The strengths of these men are the exact opposite of the high contrast men above.
Low contrast men should seek a monochromatic look, as that a strong contrasting outfit will easily overpower their muted tones.
Remember the purpose of a frame (your clothing) is to enhance the picture (your face). In general, low contrast men fair well with dark blues and earth tone dress shirts combined with dark suits.
When wearing light gray or tan suits, the low contrast gentlemen needs to stay with lighter colored shirts and earth tones; white is permissible here if the suit is light enough to avoid a stark contrast.
Be careful in your choice of tie, if the neck-wear stands out too much it can draw attention from your face to your chest and stomach.
If you don’t fall into one of the two extremes, you most likely fit into this group.
Brown skinned men with dark hair are common members, along with lighter skinned men and with gray and white hair.
With such a wide selection of facial tones and hair colors, it’s hard to give specific guidance in this category.
What we will say is that most men do not fit exactly in the middle; instead they lean towards either low or high contrast.
Dark haired men with brown skin tend to lean towards the high contrast, and can not only utilize that man’s color combinations but they can get away with a few subtle monochromatic combinations.
This can be seen as a slight advantage to the other contrast types given the amount of versatility the dark skinned man has.
As an example, a dark haired man with dark skin can easily pull off wearing a high contrast combination consisting of a dark suit with a white shirt.
On the other hand, this combination looks great with a selection less contrasting colors such as a camel blazer with the same white dress shirt.
The light skinned gentleman with light brown hair has similar advantages.
High contrast is the selection of choice for this type as it best suits the man with this skin tone.
Lastly, the light skinned gentlemen with gray hair also has the luxury of choice.
He is more similar to the low contrast individual, and would do well to follow the rules set forth for that man.
However, he can very successfully pull off a contrasting outfit, especially if his eyes or another feature complement the color combination chosen.
Gray hair, with the right skin complexion can be a huge asset for a man.
To sum it up, medium contrast men can enjoy the best of both worlds, but should be careful when venturing too far in one direction.
In conclusion, it is safe to say that what you wear is directly dependent on your hair color and skin tone.
With that said, never shy away from your own set of unique features as it is safe to say that there is a look and color combination that will fit you perfectly.
All you need is a flair for trying something fresh. Experiment until you find the right contrast set that is right for you.

Formality of a Tan Suit
Construction of the Tan Suit
Fitting a Light Brown or Tan Suit
Matching Tan Suit with other Colors
Do you need a Tan or Khaki Suit?
The English language has an abundance of words that all imply a light brownish-gray color.
Different designers frequently use different words for the same color, or the same word for very different colors.
For purposes of stylistic discussion they all behave about the same — you won’t find any set of circumstances where a “tan” suit would be appropriate but “khaki” wouldn’t be.
In their most common usage the different styles of light coat break down as follows:
These are, however, only general guidelines, and every store or designer will have a slightly different take on each color.  It’s not impossible to see other terms as well — just remember that, from a stylistic standpoint, they all follow the same rules.  Which one to purchase will be a matter of taste, complexion, and budget.
Light colors like tan are not as formal as their darker counterparts.  Brown suits in general have been a historically informal choice, and have only recently been embraced as business-wear by men looking to break-up the monotony of dark color in their wardrobe.  The lighter versions are still considered purely social wear or seasonal wear by those who adhere to strict dress rules.
Lighter color suits are also associated with spring and summer, their lighter shades signifying the lightness of the season.
Trying to wear a light colored suit in New York City during December not only invites odd looks but opens a man up to the impracticality of keeping it clean from muddy slush.
Light colored suits are best for dry & warm weather.
As a result, tan suits are usually considered business-casual wear.  They may well be appropriate attire for daily work at more relaxed offices, but will not serve at formal meetings or serious occasions.
These lighter suits shine best when worn for social and relaxed occasions — as poisonous as the term “leisure suit” has become, with its brightly-colored polyester associations, that’s exactly what most light brown/yellow/gray suits are made for.
They’re a relaxed choice for men who prefer to appear well-dressed even during their personal time.  Patterning may be used to make the suit still more casual.
Both stripes and checks are common in light brown suits, including subdued plaids of varying earth-tones.
Construction of the Tan Suit
Light-colored tan suits are often used as comfortable summer wear, and tend to be made from lighter fabrics with lighter construction in the shoulders and perhaps even unlined.
Both cotton and linen are common, in varying weaves and usually in reasonably thin cloth.  Some of these suits can be constructed without dyes, using the natural color of the thread to create a light tan.
Others will be dyed further for a deeper color, or create a pattern from threads of multiple colors woven together.
Textured cloths like tweed and corduroy are popular for their relaxed appearance and visually “busy” forms.
Wool suits can be thicker and richer-looking than their cotton or linen counterparts.  They hang in a flatter drape with a little more visual weight, and can add to a man’s bulk as well.
In tans they tend toward the yellowish-brown of camelhair, a traditionally casual look.
Camelhair jackets are rarely made from the hair of actual camels, which tends to be uncomfortably coarse; when it is a blend of softer wools is almost always used, dyed to achieve the same color.
Some natural wools also have their own light brown coloring, and can be used un-dyed in suit construction.
Khaki or tan suits can be fitted as close or as loose as the wearer pleases.
Lighter fabrics, especially linens, can be prone to wrinkling if they are improperly fitted, however — a loose suit will billow and fold, while a too-tight fit causes the material to bunch up in unattractive ripples.
A well-measured suit still needs to sit comfortably at all points without constricting movement or flapping loosely.
In fact it is worth pointing out that of all suit colors, the light browns, tans, and khakis are the least forgiving when it comes to fit as they will readily show the shadows and creases associated with bad drape and hang.
So if this suit isn’t custom, make sure it fits well off the rack and take it to a tailor for final adjustment!
As a casual garment, a light brown suit allows for numerous stylistic changes.  Flourishes that would be considered too “busy” for the boardroom are appropriate on a suit worn during leisure time.
A smaller “ticket pocket” above the normal front pockets gives the front of the suit a busier appearance, as does a boutonnière.  Nearly any light or pastel color will work as a pocket square, and can be folded as extravagantly as a man pleases.
Even rustic touches like leather elbow pads are not out of place on a casual tan suit although this final touch regulates the suit to non-business wear.
Tan, dun, and the other light shades are usefully “neutral” colors — they have no natural antecedents or opposites on the color wheel.
There are really only two ways to clash badly with a khaki or tan:  wearing very bold colors that overpower the restrained suit, or wearing colors that are similar but not quite exact matches.
Pure black and bright colors look particularly odd with the casual light browns, and should be avoided.
Any very stark shift from one color to another is going to look odd with tans — plan on a gently-gradated appearance full of neighboring colors rather than one based on attractive contrast if you’re going to make light brown a part of your outfit.
The other key to matching your tan suits well is to bring out the underlying colors of the suit.  Some tans are very heavily brown, while others have gray, yellow, or even olive green undertones.
These usually go unnoticed, but can be emphasized by the other pieces in your outfit.
Yellow striping in a tie can bring out the yellow of a khaki suit, for example, or a spring green shirt under an olive-tinted brown suit can make the entire ensemble appear very carefully-coordinated.
The opposite is also true, of course — if you wear a tan suit with faint yellow undertones and wear a light purple shirt or tie, you risk looking like an Easter egg.
Be sure to keep the dominant tones of your shirt and tie collections in mind when you buy a tan suit, and avoid anything with a contributing color that’s going to clash badly.
Light brown, tan, khaki, and taupe suits are informal wear when compared with their darker colored brethren.
They may be appropriate for some offices, but in general they are meant for days out, parties, and social engagements.
A man who enjoys dressing up to suit-and-tie standards for such occasions has a regular use for tan suits, especially when the season calls for something lighter than grey or navy.
Teachers may also find it makes a useful gap between professional dress and not looking like “the man” to students, though the latter may be a hopeless endeavor no matter what you wear.
If you only wear suits as a business matter and prefer a more casual standard for your personal life, you may not need a light brown suit in your closet.
It could serve as an occasional outfit for work-related parties, particularly in the summer, but the odds are that you’d be able to find something else to work just as well.
The tan suit is ideal for the man looking to expand his dress wardrobe without adding yet another piece of business-formal wear that looks overdressed in casual company."

Introduction to Dressing for a Law School Interview
This article discusses how to properly dress for a law school interview.
Typically law school and legal job interviews are with law firms, large companies with legal departments, and government/state organizations.
The information is based off of numerous interviews with recent top law school graduates, as well as the author’s expert opinion on the psychological effects of dress and rules of classic men’s style;
It is relevant to anyone wanting to understand the nuances of high level interview presentation and communication.
Behind every successful law interview are hours of preparation.
As you study the firm you are going to interview with, pay attention to their unstated dress code.
Maybe you have met a few of their employees; how did they present themselves? Were they conservative or relaxed in the appearance?
Interviewing with Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is very different than interviewing with Latham & Watkins; both require a suit, but you may be able to get away with a little more color out in California.
You must understand that because you can control your personal presentation, failure to meet the basic levels of accepted appearance is a strike that will be held against you.
Proper planning and taking the time to select clothing that is timeless and conservative will ensure you have little to fear when you stand in front of an interviewer. And as Woody Allen says, 80% of success is showing up.
Your Law School Interview Suit 
The good news for the law student is that the classical men’s suit style has remained the same for a hundred years.
The bad news is that there are a lot of fashion suits out there that become dated faster than you can purchase them and wear twice.
The key is to ignore temporary fashion, and understand what your timeless style is.
Remember three things when choosing an interview suit: Fabric, Style, and Fit. 
When selecting a suit fabric for a law school interview, take into consideration the fabrics construction, makeup, and color.
Try to go with a natural fabric, preferably a worsted wool. If you go with a blend, try to ensure the synthetic make-up is 40% or less and that it doesn’t have a shine to it.
Although blends keep the cost down, they do not last as long and have a tendency to breathe less.
As to color choice, the safest selections are navy blue, charcoal, and black. Although you can move outside these, understand you will stick out (not always a bad thing!).
When it comes to men’s suit style, go with a classical cut. In the United States this is a single breasted, notched lapel, two or three button jacket with a single or double back vent and regular flap pockets.
Ensure you have at least as many cuff buttons as you have front jacket buttons (four buttons on the sleeve is normal) and check for a left breast pocket.
 Avoid patch pockets, peak lapels, and slanted side pockets for legal interviews. Also pay close attention to lapel width: a trend right now is thin lapels; avoid this fashion fad.
With your trousers, consider pleated fronts. They are more formal that flat front trousers, and are generally more comfortable.
Cuffed bottoms usually look best on tall men, although either cuffed or un-cuffed is fine for a law interview.
After that inspect the jacket and trousers for quality construction by tugging on buttons and inspecting the sewing.
Finally, fit; most men wear suits that are too large in one area or another.
Try to find a brand whose cut matches your build, and don’t be afraid of going custom if you are difficult to fit or value your time and do not want to spend weeks shopping.
Ensure the sleeves (when standing) show ½ to 1 inch of cuff and that the jacket lapels lay flat. You do not want the jacket when buttoned to form an “X” from tightness and the jackets shoulders should not extend past your shoulders.
Finally, the jacket back should cover your backside, there should be no bunching of fabric in the back near your neck, and your jacket collar should show ¾ of an inch of shirt collar.
One way to get a perfect fit is to have your suit made to measure or hand crafted by a tailor, commonly referred to as bespoke.
For the law student or recent graduate willing to invest at least 600 to 1000 dollars per suit, this is a great option; it will save you the time and frustration of searching for the ideal fitting jacket by helping you get exactly what you want quickly.
Men who go down this path fall in love with the selection (thousands of fabrics), control over the build (any style, secret pockets, etc), and of course the perfect fit that no off-the-rack men’s suit can emulate.
And when you are spending 100K+ on your education, the cost of the suit seems insignificant when it helps you land the job you seek.
Your Law School Interview Dress Shirt 
Shirt fabrics come in a much wider variety of colors and weaves than men’s suits; a pink striped herringbone dress shirt can turn an ordinary navy suit into a outfit that demands attention while a conservative white broadcloth dress shirt can tone down a striped suit’s allure.
It is no mystery that white and blue fabrics dominate the field; wearing earth tones or darker colored dress shirts requires skilled coordination and should be approached carefully when dressing for a legal interview.
However, going with a unique fabric weave (such as a twill or herringbone) in a conservative color is a great way to retain your individuality while not making to much noise with your clothing ensemble.
For law interviews, you might want to avoid patterns as that they make an outfit less formal; stick with solids of various weaves.
Two parts of your shirt will be showing when you wear a jacket; the collar and the cuffs. You should be able to put two fingers in-between your neck and the collar when buttoned.
Your sleeves and cuffs should extend to the top of your hands, and you want to show approximately ½ to 1 inch of shirt cuff from under your jacket sleeve.
The collar type should be chosen based off of your facial structure. Men with long, thin faces should go with spread collars while round faced men should look to even out their face with a point collar.
Normal barrel cuffs with one or two buttons are fine for all interviews; you may be tempted to wear cufflinks to your interview, but be careful. Some interviewers view this display of cuff jewelry as obnoxious.
The Law School Interview Tie 
Your tie should be conservative for a legal interview. Red, Blue, Green or Gold are all popular favorites; stand out from the crowd by choosing a tie with a simple repeating pattern.
Striped ties are a good choice, but you should be aware as to whether it is a regimental tie or not.
In England, memberships of military clubs are symbolized by striped tie design. Unless you are going to be eating (where it serves to hold the tie in place), there is no reason to use a tie clip or tie pin in a law interview.
Avoid bright colors, designs that draw attention from your face, and do not – I repeat, do not wear a novelty tie.
Dress Shoes For Law Interviews 
We recommend a plain or capped black oxford.
They feature round toes and closed lacing. Plain Oxfords are one of the most formal options for business wear.
Oxfords with broguing along the cap’s edge, or trimming the uppers, are still formal enough for a law interview in the US; in Europe they are normally more formal about these things, so be careful.
Do not wear slip-ons, whether they are loafers, boots, or monkstraps.
Although these are perfectly fine for a business casual luncheon or a suit without the tie, in a formal interview you need to have classic oxfords.
Law School Interview Socks
Yes, you need a pair only for law school interviews – label them and never wear them except for interviews. (Just Kidding!) Your socks should match your slacks or shoes and be preferably dark in color.
The goal here is to not draw attention to your legs. This isn’t the time to sport the no sock/short sock look or try that new pair of flashy hosiery.
If the socks are seen, they should appear to flow seamlessly between the shoes and trouser cuff.
Law School Interviews and Jewelry 
A wedding ring is always acceptable in an legal interview.
Anything else is fair game and left up to the interviewer’s personal views on this matter.
A class ring from Harvard, Yale, or Texas may give you a leg up if your interviewer is an Alumni or if you are in Dallas.
But it may backfire. Nose rings, eye piercings, and earrings are becoming more accepted, but these pieces of jewelry do send a message.
You cannot wear these pieces without it affecting a person’s impression of you.
Be yourself, but be aware that it may not go over well with the interviewer.
With a watch, keep it simple. No alarm….in fact leave the digital at home along with the expensive looking Rolex. A simple leather band and timeless timepiece is all you need.
Grooming before the Legal Interview 
Get a haircut a few days before the interview and ensure they trim around the neck and ears.
Pay attention to the small things – your nails should be cut and clean and avoid cologne; this isn’t a date, and you might be in close quarters or a closed room.
Final thoughts in preparing for your law interview – arrive early, get 8 hours of sleep, and be genuinely enthusiastic about the firm or company you are seeking to work for."
https://atailoredsuit.com/good-mens-dress-shoes.html,"The surest barometer of a man’s style is his shoes.
Any investment of time, money, and care taken in dressing the body is squandered by the man who neglects his feet.
While advances in textile manufacture and global supply chain management have reduced the cost of clothing significantly in recent decades, good footwear has not gotten cheaper.
Quality dress shoes start around $300, and they are well worth it.
They are incredibly comfortable, even when new, and will last twenty years if properly cared for.
Unlike suits and ties, a man rarely risks appearing overdressed in fine shoes, so they offer today’s man a way to bring class to his weekend attire without drawing snide comments from t-shirted friends and family.
If you are still smarting from the thought of spending $300 on a pair of shoes, consider this: department store dress shoes consisting of cheap leather glued to rubber soles cost at least $100, and can generally be expected to last two years at most.
At this point, the leather develops notable signs of fatigue, and the soles crack or wear thin. Repairing often costs as much as a new pair. On the other hand, the $300 shoes, made of good leather stitched to leather soles, will last decades.
Depending on how you walk, they may need resoling every few years, at a cost of about $60. Quality shoe leather actually improves with age, as it develops a deep, rich shine from years of polish.
Thus, $300 shoes are an investment that will pay dividends long after their cost is forgotten, along with most anything else a man could have spent his money on.
As a general rule, good men’s shoes are made by companies whose primary business is the manufacture of men’s shoes: Allen-Edmonds, Alden, John Lobb, Church’s, and Crockett & Jones are all excellent choices.
If you have not heard of some or all of these companies, it is because they spend their customers’ money on quality materials and skilled craftsmen, rather than extensive advertising campaigns. Their shoes sell themselves.
On the other hand, the shoes sold by high-end fashion labels are often made by third-party manufacturers using cheap materials and shoddy construction, and are little better than department store shoes, whatever their price tag.
Once you have invested in a decent pair of shoes, you must care for them properly if you wish for them to last. When you buy them, also buy a pair of cedar shoe trees.
These spring-loaded contraptions fit into your shoes when you take them off, returning the shoes to their original shape and absorbing moisture and odor. Ideally, the shoe trees should be left in for twenty-four hours after each wearing, which means owning at least two pairs of shoes.
If you can only afford to buy one pair when starting out, at least having the shoe trees in overnight will help the shoes stand up to constant wear until you can afford to bring in reinforcements. When putting shoes on, always use a shoe horn, to prevent creasing the leather around the heel.
Finally, good shoes require polish. Unpolished leather looks sloppy and immature, and will also fray and crack.
It takes only ten or fifteen minutes to clean and polish a pair of shoes once every half-dozen wearings, and less than sixty seconds each morning to brush the dirt out of the cracks and run a rag across the tops.
Polish them with the trees in, first cleaning the leather with Kiwi Saddle Soap or some similar leather cleaner.
This prevents layers of polish from accumulating into gunk, and also helps to preserve the leather.
Then, work the polish into the leather with your ‘dirty’ rag, let it set for five minutes, and wipe off the excess residue with the same rag. For the finish, buff them vigorously with a clean rag, taking care that left and right emerge with the same degree of shine.
If you would like to purchase any of these shoes, please contact the fine Gentlemen at Leffot in NYC. These photos are from their amazing blog."
https://atailoredsuit.com/gray-flannel-trousers.html,"Pants should not be the focal point of a man’s outfit.
Rather, a trouser’s job is to quickly draw the eye upward to your sport jacket or downward to your dress shoes, and perhaps subtly flatter your legs.
The fact is, most men are better served highlighting another part of their body.
Additionally, since the legs move next to each other, a pattern that appears elegant on the torso such as herringbone or windowpane can easily become jarring below it.
It is no wonder, therefore, that virtually all men’s trousers sold today are solid in color. Which is the beauty of men’s solid gray flannel trousers. They are simple, elegant and functional.
Continue to read on to discover how this timeless classic can be incorporated into your wardrobe.

Gray, that most neutral of colors, does an excellent job of matching everything yet playing second fiddle to anything you pair with it.
Whoever wears a sport coat, wherever and however he wears it, cannot go wrong pairing it with gray flannels.
This wonderful fabric is made from Merino wool, and comfortably warm in fall, winter and spring. Softer than worsted, it does not hold a crease with the same rigidity as its more formal cousin.
This makes it the ideal complement to the sport coat, given the latter’s heritage as dignified causal wear.
Just as the gray suit looks good with any shirt and tie, so do gray trousers provide a sure footing for any sport coat ensemble.
They work with brown or black shoes, from oxfords to loafers (although most jackets have a slightly narrower range).
There is no color or pattern of shirt, tie, or jacket with which it clashes. That means that once you have picked out a combination of these three that complement each other well, you’re done!
Step into your gray flannels and you are guaranteed a harmonious, interchangeable outfit.
This does not imply that gray flannels are an easy way out of the sometimes difficult task of color and pattern matching. Indeed, Fred Astaire, one of the best dressed men of the twentieth century and one renowned for his daring agility in mixing fabrics, wore gray flannel trousers more often than not.
There’s plenty of room to be interesting above the waist and below the ankles.
Color aside, the texture of flannel is dressy enough for a blazer and tie while maintaining a long reach down the formality spectrum.
With a turtleneck in your favorite color, they’re comfortable and casual, perfect for a Fall Saturday morning at home.
When it comes time to go out, you can don any jacket in your closet without worrying about whether it will match your bottoms.
Herein lies another of these pants’ advantages: They look just as good without a jacket as they do with one, allowing you to easily adjust the formality of your attire during the day without having to change.
In conclusion, any sport coat will look good with a variety of pants.
Better, though, that you own a variety of sport coats, and keep the pants simple and functional.
So gentleman, you can clearly see that gray flannels go brilliantly with any jacket, and without compromising its versatility or allure. Flannel trousers will last for years, and like the classic navy blazer, they will never go out of style.

https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-vest-waistcoat.html,"The modern men’s vest, like many fashionable accents, began life as a functional piece of outerwear.
Servants working outside added a narrow coat across the front of their torso for extra warmth, and the waistcoat quickly evolved into a staple of every well-dressed man’s winter outfits.
By the late nineteenth-century waistcoats were a popular accessory both with and without jackets, and they have remained reasonably unchanged in their role ever since.
The term “waistcoat” is generally a more specific one than “vest” — it refers, literally enough, to a sleeveless garment that covers a man’s waist, hiding the top of the trousers and the bottom of the shirt.
In a vested or three-piece suit, the waistcoat is made from the same fabric and lining as the rest of the suit, creating a uniform stretch of cloth from the ankles to the chest.
Worn separately, waistcoats and vests are flexible pieces of menswear that can fill roles in formal or casual wear alike.
A black-tie waistcoat is a very specific piece of clothing. They are never meant to be worn without the accompanying jacket. Many are “backless,” with only a strap to fasten them.
Formal waistcoats often feature lapels, which is uncommon on most other vests. They tend to be cut much lower in the front than the waistcoats that accompany three-piece suits, leaving more of the formal dress shirt visible.
While formal waistcoats are usually made from the same black fabric as the tuxedo jacket, there is room at most formal events for a tasteful vest in a separate color instead.
The gaudy colors you sometimes see at rental outlets remain novelty items, but a rich burgundy red or deep green is appropriate enough to be worn in front of the Queen of England — and has been.
The three-piece suit was standard in the early 20th century, falling out of fashion in WWII when cloth rationing limited their availability.
It remains a striking piece of menswear, similar to the double-breasted suit jacket in formality and elegance. The best-looking men’s waistcoats will usually be tailored to get the close fit and appropriate relation to the jacket needed for a proper look.
Suit waistcoats always cover the waist and should rise just above the lapels of the jacket, spreading wide enough to fit over the shoulders without laying under the shirt collar.Like the formal waistcoat, men’s suits can incorporate an unmatched (or “odd”) vest.
The look then becomes more dressed-down, almost playful — suitable for a relaxed evening on the town rather than a serious business event.
Patterns are also popular in odd waistcoats, providing a cheerful contrast to the jacket above them.
As a stand-alone item of clothing, a waistcoat similar to those worn with a three-piece suit is an appropriate piece of business-casual wear.
It serves a similar function to a casual sportcoat, adding a touch of color and style to a dress shirt and trousers without attempting to imitate the formality of a matched suit.
Here an “odd” or unmatched waistcoat is preferred, as matched trousers and a waistcoat tend to give the impression of a man who forgot his suit jacket. Rolling the sleeves of the dress shirt up can help to make it clear that the vest-and-trousers outfit is deliberately chosen, but reduces the formality.
Worn casually, a waistcoat offers more opportunity for outspoken style than when it is paired with a jacket. The pattern and color may take the center stage without fear of clashing. Since men rarely wear waistcoats in modern America, the look is already an eye-catching one — adding an active pattern will hardly make it look less striking or more out-of-place.
Traditional stripes or checks are perfectly acceptable, as are more flamboyant creations with elaborate figure patterns or diamond panes. A vest on its own may have lapels or not; the former is more old-fashioned.
Even worn casually vests tend to look out-of-place without accompanying neckwear. Bow ties make particularly elegant accompaniments for the man with confidence, as do old-fashioned “straight” ties with no change in width from top to bottom and a flat tip (which will of course be hidden below the vest).
For the true dandy there are many styles of cravat to experiment with, but it will be impossible to avoid looking affectedly old-fashioned in one. This may well be the desired effect for a vest-wearer, but be aware that it does border on costuming rather than fashion, and exercise some restraint.
The button-fronted waistcoat is hardly the only vest available in menswear. Sleeveless jackets appear as everything from pajama tops to outerwear.
Barbour of London even makes a waterproof vest version of its iconic jacket, though one has to wonder at the usefulness.
The undress vest is generally seen as a stylish flourish on whatever parent garment spawned it — and, from a more practical standpoint, is one that can be worn in somewhat warmer weather.
A sweater-vest can be worn to basically the same functions that a sweater can, but appears as a more conscious choice on the wearer’s part simply by being the less common option.
The same applies to fleece activewear, and so on — these are all undress garments, made for casual day-to-day wear with friends and family. A vested style is a minor stylistic flourish and a comfortable choice for warmer weather.
Like sweaters, sweater-vests can be very casual or more dressed-up depending on the style and how they are worn. A single color or very muted pattern will always be more formal, and wearing it with a dress shirt and necktie will of course be dressier as well.
Vests in the Man’s Wardrobe
Vests and waistcoats are elegant garments that add more to an outfit than most accesories. They can add formality to suits, style to unmatched outfits, comfort to casual wear, or warmth to business dress in cool weather.
A three-piece suit is an excellent starting place for a man with no other vested outfits, as the vest can be worn separately with other garments – the only caution here is that any piece of a suit will, if worn too frequently, wear and become lighter in color than the other pieces.
Rotate the wardrobe to keep everything matching properly.
After a first waistcoat, the decision of how often to wear vested garments is really every man’s choice. Any style worn without variation gets boring, so don’t be “the vest guy” — but have at least a few standing by for days when a little extra flair is called for.
The versatility and unusual style of waistcoats and vests is too good for a well-dressed man to pass on entirely."
https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-dress-shirts-introduction.html,"The dress shirt is a button-up shirt with a collar and long sleeves.
It is cut differently than the sport shirt, which is made to be worn open-necked and looks awkward with a tie.
The dress shirt is designed to carry a jacket and tie, but can be worn without one or the other, or with neither.
Various shirts with different sorts of collars and cuffs are appropriate for different ranges of attire, and many can run the gamut of formality.
We do not discuss the short-sleeve shirts here as that their lack of sleeves prevents them from being worn with a jacket, a prerequisite for a dress shirt.
Over the past half-century, the dress shirt has gone from being an undergarment to holding a prominent place in many outfits.
This is one reason why it is today available in so many more colors and patterns than the plain white ubiquitous in days past.
Additionally, when most working men’s jobs involved getting their hands dirty, clean white cuffs were a status symbol, a symbol that the man wearing them was above the dirty work.
Today whether one’s style is chinos or suit-and-tie, shirts are an essential means of expanding one’s wardrobe, since they both offer more variety and cost less than suits, shoes, and most other items in men’s dress.
Whatever it is worn with, a shirt should fit snugly without restricting movement.
Just as the shirt protects the jacket’s lining from absorbing too much grease and sweat from the skin beneath, an undershirt can take the brunt of perspiration to keep a dress shirt looking fresh all day and extend its life.
If the shirt is to be worn open-necked, a crew-neck t-shirt will peek out below the throat, an adolescent look most men do well to avoid. V-neck tees are much safer.
Some men prefer to feel the dress shirt’s finer fabric against their skin, and forgo an undershirt altogether. The first thing that jumps out about a shirt is its color and pattern, closely followed by its fabric type.
Although the vast majority of men’s shirts are solid white or blue, a man with an understanding of his complexion and what complements it opens himself up to a much wider range of colors and designs.
Golds, lavenders, pinks, and an endless variety of striped and checked patterns are available for the taking;
The skillful pairing of the right shirt with a conservative suit can turn an ordinary outfit into an extraordinary one. As to fabric type, this depends mostly on your personal preference and needs.
Pure sea island cotton represents the higher end and more expensive fibers, while a pima cotton and man-made fiber blend will appeal to the individual on a more modest budget.
Both fabrics can be built into excellent garments; the choice is more about what you value and the fabric properties you seek.
For more information on shirt fabrics click here.
Next, we begin our discussion of shirt style. There are many key elements to a dress shirt’s style; the collar, the cuffs, the yoke, the shirt’s back, the front button style, the choice of buttons, pockets, and the choice of a monogram all have a say in the attitude the shirt will project.
A button down collar, left breast pocket, and single-button cuffs signal leisure while a shirt with turned-down point collar, no breast pocket, and french cuffs signals formality.
The beauty of a custom shirt is that you can design the shirt’s style not only for the occasion but also to complement your physical features.
More on shirt styles is covered in A Deeper Understanding of the Dress Shirt.
A bit of advice for beginners – if building your dress shirt collection seek versatility in your clothing. To maximize value and eliminate confusion, you want to be able to wear any dress shirt with any suit you own.
Avoid extremes, and slowly build your range by experimenting with patterns, colors, and styles that complement your features. Once you have this down, you can with confidence move into complex world of multi-color patterns and eccentric style."
https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-dress-shirt-deeper-understanding.html,"Many details go into the construction of a men’s dress shirt, and the more attention one pays to these the better results one can achieve in purchasing and wearing one.
Shirt fabrics are given their own separate article; this article deals chiefly with the construction and design features of men’s dress shirts.
If you haven’t yet read our introduction to dress shirts, we advise doing so as that it lays a foundation for this article’s topics.In retail stores, men’s shirts are sized by collar circumference and sleeve length.
Most are cut to fit the most corpulent members of each size, and thus look blousy on most men.
Those with an uncommon pairing of neck size and arm length have difficulty even finding a shirt that fits in these two places.
Since even the simplest alterations can add 25-50% to the price of a dress shirt, it is often more economical to have shirts made to one’s exact measurements.
For a man starting out who is unable to afford custom-made, the best bet is to try on a lot of shirts until one finds a particular size of a particular brand that fits him well in the chest, stomach, neck, and sleeves, and then buy as many colors and patterns of these as he can find.
Aside from fabric and fit, a man has a few matters of construction to consider when picking out or ordering a shirt: Collar, cuffs, pocket, placket, and pleats.
As with fit, in retail these are standardized to the lowest common denominator and one has little choice in the matter. Even in a store with thousands and thousands of shirts, you will likely be able to count on one hand the few that are really what you want.
The men’s dress shirt collar is the most important, both in determining the garment’s level of formality and in flattering the wearer’s unique face.
Button-down collars are the least formal, and are the best collars to wear without a tie.
They also go well with a tie and sweater, blazer, or sport coat.  The wing collar, which does not cover the band of the tie around the neck, is reserved for formal wear.
Most men’s dress shirts sport some sort of pointed collar, but there is huge room for variety here.
While the standard point collar looks good on most men, those with narrower faces do better with slightly shorter ones, while round faces carry well above long collar points.
As a general rule, the greater the angle between the short sides of the collar points, the more formal the presentation. Spread collars, which leave a wide opening between them, take large tie knots especially well.
The edges of the cut-away collar nearly form a straight line above the tie knot; this is the most formal collar arrangement.
An exception to the parallelism of spread and formality is the tab collar: here little tabs of fabric extending from each side connect behind the tie knot, holding the collar close together and projecting the knot outward for a precise, no-nonsense look.
The white contrast collar, in any style, with or without matching white French cuffs, is a favorite of power-dressers.
While it certainly raises a suit-and-tie above the masses, let the wearer be warned against it if he cannot equal its eminence.
On most decent dress shirts, the collar’s points are kept straight by collar stays. These 2- to 3-inch pointed splints are inserted into slots on the underside of the collar after ironing, and later removed for washing. Besides the plastic ones that come with most shirts, you can buy them in brass, silver, and even ivory, but their material has negligible effect on their function. For a in depth look at dress shirt collars, click here.
Barrel cuffs, standard on most dress shirts, come in a variety of styles and except for the most formal of occasions are never the wrong choice.
The common variety have a single button; cuffs with two or even three buttons are somewhat more artful.
French cuffs are de rigeur for formal wear; they look good with a suit but are always optional. A button in the sleeve placket helps the sleeve to stay closed during wear and can be opened to iron the cuffs; it is optional but nearly ubiquitous.
The traditional left breast pocket adds a little depth to a dress shirt, especially if worn without jacket and tie, and can be useful for holding pens, tickets, and the like.
A shirt with no pockets can look slightly cleaner with a coat and tie, but since the coat covers the pocket the difference is minimal when wearing a suit.
As with most things, simplicity equals formality, so the pocketless shirt is the dressiest.
The placket is the edge of the left front panel, with the button holes on it.
The standard placket is a strip of fabric raised off the men’s dress shirt front with stitches down each side; this is what most casual shirts and many dress shirts have.
In the more modern French placket, the edge of the shirt front is folded over, creased, and held together only by the button holes.
This cleaner front sharpens more formal dress shirts; it should not, however, be combined with a button-down collar.
A man’s back is not flat; thus we use pleats on the back panel of a shirt so that the fabric may hang from the yoke (the piece covering the shoulder blades) and better conform to the body.
There are two common varieties of pleated shirt back styles: the box pleat consists of two pleats spaced one-and-a-half inches apart at the center, while side pleats lie halfway between each edge and the center of the back.
While the former are more common on ready-to-wear shirts, the latter better align with the actual shape of the back, and thus fit most men better.
A well-made custom shirt can be cut and sewn to fit its wearer perfectly without pleats, and this makes it cleaner and easier to iron.
Nonetheless, many men prefer to have pleats even on their bespoke dress shirts.
 Finally, a man may elect to have his shirt monogrammed, usually on the edge of the breast pocket (or in a similar place on a pocketless shirt).
Monogramming originated as a way to identify one’s shirts in a commercial laundry, akin to writing a child’s name on the tag of their jacket.
More recently, as the shirt has taken a more prominent role in men’s dress, the monogram has emerged as a way to subtly communicate the care a man has taken in obtaining his clothes.
While large, garish monograms certainly do more harm than good, many men enjoy the quiet display of their initials, usually in a color similar to the shirt’s own."
https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-suit-fabrics.html,"When ordering a custom suit, a man is confronted with a sometimes daunting selection of fabrics.
While proportion and fit are mostly dictated by your body, you may select your suit’s fabric considering climate, occasion, and the image you hope to project.
What follows is a primer on textile terminology intended to demystify the world of suit fabrics.
For centuries now, most men’s suits have been made out of wool. This trusty textile drapes beautifully, maintains its form reliably, and can be spun (from raw fiber into yarn) and woven (from yarn into fabric) to be lightweight and breathable, or to be warm and cozy.
Worsted wool, from which most suits are made, goes through a finishing process that leaves it smooth and somewhat shiny.
Suitings are often categorized by fineness. The yarn number, e.g. 90s, originally meant the number of 560-yard spools a spinner could get out of a pound of raw wool at the thickness in question, with three-digit numbers earning the prefix “Super.”
Since textiles are not strictly regulated in most countries, these numbers may be exaggerated. Finer yarns are smoother in appearance, softer to the touch, and produce lighter fabrics.
They are also more expensive, less durable, and more prone to wrinkling. 80s wool makes beautiful suitings that are perfect for work. Super 100s is a bit more luxurious, and Super 120s is incredibly smooth.
Many men believe that anything finer is too finicky for normal wear, but for those who crave decadently fine cloths the high-tech textile manufacturers turn out fabrics as fine as Super 200s.
The weight of the fabric, e.g. 10 oz, is what a yard of the material weighs. Heavier fabrics are, naturally, warmer than lighter ones. 10-12 oz suitings are ideal for spring and fall, as well as Northern summers and Southern winters (hence the term “three-season”).
Lighter fabrics, often called “tropical” wool without a specific weight, are nearly as cool as shorts, perfect for hot summers. Flannel and tweed, in weights of 14 to 18 oz, are best for cold winters.
Wool flannel is not finished the same way that worsted wool is, and it is therefore softer, even slightly fuzzy. It can be heavy, for winter, or light, for spring, fall, and cooler summers.
Flannel was the fabric of choice for corporate men of the post-war United States, as shown in the 1956 film The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, and today it retains a prominent spot in the pantheon of business attire."
https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-suit-jacket-details.html,"Having looked at an introduction of the men’s suit, it is now time to deepen our understanding with a more detailed exploration of its main component, the jacket.
A men’s suit jacket has many underpinnings and options, and each is an important part of selecting a garment that will flatter and enhance ones individual characteristics.
The first and perhaps most noticeable element of the jacket is whether it is a single or double-breasted suit jacket.
Single-breasted men’s suits have a single row of buttons down the front, and the jacket flaps only overlap enough to permit buttoning.
A double-breasted suit has two rows of buttons, and the front overlaps sufficiently to allow both flaps to be attached to the opposite row of buttons.
The choice between single- and double-breasted is a matter of personal taste, though the vast majority of American men choose single breasted suits; a lack of familiarity with the double-breasted option may account for some of the single-breasted suit’s dominance.
Being that it is a less common choice, a double-breasted suit will make the wearer stand out, and on the right man, can be an excellent choice.
Thin gentlemen, particularly those who are somewhat taller, can benefit greatly from double-breasted suits, as they will give a fuller appearance to the figure; on larger men, double-breasted suits can have a tendency to draw attention to the midsection, so careful attention and an expert tailor should be employed.
The jacket’s foremost obligation is to frame one’s face in a flattering manner and direct the eye upward towards it, assisted by the dress shirt and tie.
The width of one’s shoulders plays a crucial part in the perception of the face and head, and so form the first major element of the jacket. Wide, excessively padded shoulders shorten the neck and make the head seem excessively small, while unsupported, extremely narrow shoulders can make one’s head resemble a parade float.
For most men, the shoulders should be natural, supported but not over-padded, and should slope gently up, drawing the eye towards the head and face.
Additional padding can be added within reason to produce a more confident, commanding appearance and give the illusion of height, while a softer, more sloped shoulder can be used to offset extra height.
Attached to the shoulders is the collar, and with it the lapel, which stretches down to where the buttons begin.
Lapels come in a variety of styles with a number of options. The lapels’ width is perhaps subject to the most variance, with the extremely narrow lapels of the 1950s standing in stark contrast to the excessively wide lapels of the 1970s.
As is the case with much of classic fashion, the most timeless lapels are of a moderate width.
In addition to different widths, lapels come in three styles: notched, which has a wide, V-shaped opening where the lapel and collar join; peaked, which flares out in a sharp point, with a very narrow, deep V at the join; and shawl, where the lapel and collar are indistinguishable, curving from around the neck all the way down to where the lapels end.
Notched and peaked lapels are equally classic, though the latter are most commonly found on double-breasted jackets. Shawl collars are almost exclusively limited to formal-wear, though they occasionally appear on ready-made suits – these should be avoided if a classic look is desired.
Where the lapels end, one finds the waist buttons. As previously indicated, a suit jacket has either one row of buttons or two, depending on whether it is single- or double-breasted. A single-breasted jacket has a single row of buttons, numbering anywhere from one to four, though two and three are most standard, while a single-button is generally limited to the tuxedo.
The three-button jacket, although a sometimes unfamiliar garment to those unaccustomed to wearing suits, is the most traditional configuration, taking its cue from English riding jackets; properly worn, it gives the illusion of height.
Traditionally, only the middle or second button is fastened when standing, though the top two buttons may be fastened to produce a slightly more formal appearance. Two-button suits are a slightly later innovation, and because they show more of the shirt and tie, can produce a slightly more slimming appearance.
Only the top button of a two-button jacket is fastened; with the exception of a jacket with only one button, the bottom button of a single-breasted jacket is never fastened.
Four-button jackets are somewhat more rare than the other options, but are an elegant choice for the very tall man; because of his height, a four-button suit on a very tall man emulates the look of a three-button jacket on a shorter man.
It is very common to see professional basketball players wearing four-button suits; the loud colors and wild patterns often chosen by celebrities, however, should be avoided by the gentleman. Unlike two- and three-button suits, where the bottom button is left undone, a four-button jacket is worn with all four buttons fastened.
Double-breasted jackets most commonly have either four or six buttons on each side – where there are six buttons, only the lower four are for buttoning, though due to the design of the suit, only two will actually be buttoned at any given time. There is also an extra hidden button on the reverse of the outside flap of a double-breasted suit, onto which the inside or “hidden” flap attaches.
Contrary to the habits of certain celebrities, a double-breasted jacket is never left unbuttoned when standing, permitting it to flap around wildly; it is always securely buttoned upon standing and remains buttoned until one is again seated. Additionally, while the bottom button of a single-breasted jacket is always left undone, both of the operable buttons on a double-breasted jacket are fastened.
As with the gorge of the lapel, the height of the waist buttons can be altered slightly to accentuate or diminish height, but this must be done carefully.
Inherent in all the above elements is the jacket’s length.
A jacket that is too short will expose undesirable portions of the wearer’s anatomy, while a jacket that is overly long will dwarf the wearer, potentially giving the appearance of a 1930s film gangster, or in the case of extremely long sleeves, an orangutan.
Because of the modern trend towards lowering the gorge and waist buttons on jackets, as well as the tendency of many men to wear their pants at their hips, rather than at the waist, most men have become accustomed to jackets that are too long.
A properly-fitting jacket will have its waist button just below the wearer’s actual waist, and should have sleeves that leave room for a minimum of 1″ of the wearer’s shirt cuff to be visible.
A very general way of determining if a jacket is long enough is to curl one’s fingers at the second knuckle around the bottom of the jacket.
If the jacket’s hem just reaches where the fingers join to the hand, then it fits properly; if the hem touches the curled fingers – or worse, bunches up – then the jacket is too long.
Another gauge is to measure from the top of the spine to the floor and divide in half. Both techniques, however, are only generalizations, and cannot take into account any unusual variations; performed correctly, both will give a relatively good measure for a ready-made suit, while a bespoke or made-to-measure suit will involve more accurate measurement.
In the same line, a jacket’s sleeves should be well fitted to the particular dimensions of the wearer’s arm, and should taper as necessary to avoid the appearance of flaring out towards the hand. The cuffs should be wide enough to allow free movement, though not so wide as to hang loosely when the arms are raised; likewise, they should not be as narrow as to resemble the elasticized cuffs on rain jackets.
Many other elements round out the details of the suit jacket – vents, pockets, buttons, and more — all of which lie within The Suit: The Jacket Completed."
https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-suit-jacket-complete.html,"With an introduction of the men’s suit jacket successfully behind us, as well as a more detailed men’s suit discussion, it is now the time to complete our examination of the elements of the suit jacket.
With a firm grasp of the elements that make up the core of the jacket, we can now look into the details that transform a jacket from ordinary clothing into a distinctive and individual feature of the wardrobe.
There are numerous historical reasons for jacket sleeves bearing buttons, from encouraging the use of handkerchiefs to allowing a gentleman to wash his hands without removing his jacket, a traditionally grave social offense in mixed company.
Whatever the reason for their arrival on jacket sleeves, they now form an important part of the detail work or trimming of the jacket.
Most traditionally, men’s suit jacket sleeves bear four buttons, though it is not uncommon to find three.
Regardless of number, they should always match the waist buttons, and are always placed within a half-inch or so of the hem.
On bespoke suits, and even some of the higher-quality made-to-measure jackets, the sleeve buttons are functional, though there is little reason to ever use them – rather, it is a subtle declaration of the jacket’s quality.
When the buttons are functional, there is some temptation to leave one button undone in order to draw attention to the feature – and by extension, the quality of the men’s suit – though this is a matter of personal taste.
Moving on from the jacket sleeves, we have the pockets, which present a variety of options, all at differing levels of formality.
The most formal are jetted pockets, where the pocket is sewn into the lining of the jacket and only a narrow horizontal opening appears on the side of the suit jacket.
These pockets, being nearly invisible, contribute to a very sleek, polished appearance, and are most frequently found on formal-wear.
The next style, the flap pocket, is slightly less formal, though it is perfectly acceptable in all the circumstances where a gentleman is likely to be found in a men’s suit.
Flap pockets are made identically to jetted pockets, but include a flap sewn into the top of the pocket, which covers the pocket’s opening.
These are the most common pockets on men’s suit jackets, and in the very best, are fabricated so that the wearer may tuck the flaps inside, mimicking the jetted pocket.
There are also diagonally-cut flap pockets known as hacking pockets, though they are somewhat less common; the hacking pocket is derived from English riding gear, and is most prominent on bespoke suits from English tailors, particularly those traditionally associated with riding clothes.
The least formal are patch pockets, which are exactly what the name implies: pockets created by applying a patch to the outside of the jacket. Patch pockets are the most casual option; they are frequently found on summer suits that would otherwise appear overly formal, as well as on sports jackets.
On the subject of pockets and things the conscientious wearer avoids, there are a few guidelines for utilizing the pockets on suit jackets.
While the outside pockets on most jackets are functional, placing large bulky items – including the hands – in these pockets will distort the silhouette of the jacket.
Keys and other sharp objects should be kept away from the jacket pockets, as they can damage the lining, leaving holes into which small objects are invariably drawn.
Many jackets come with the pockets sewn shut, and while it is generally better to open them, those who have difficulty remembering what to avoid may find it beneficial to leave them unopened.
The side pockets are not the only pockets on the jacket, however. Some men’s suit jackets, particularly bespoke and finer made-to-measure offerings, include a small ticket pocket above one of the side pockets, generally on the same side as the wearer’s dominant hand.
This pocket is rarely used in modern times, and serves more as an indication of the suit’s quality. Moving up the jacket is the breast pocket, which is always open, and into which only one item is ever placed: the handkerchief or pocket square.
The reason for this is twofold:
 Inside pockets vary greatly, with some jackets having only one, usually on the left, though it is more common to have pockets on both sides.
These pockets are generally large enough to carry a checkbook-sized wallet or card case, as well as a pen and perhaps tickets or other similar papers, though one should be careful, as bulky items, even in the inside pockets, can distort the jacket’s appearance.
On bespoke suits, the options for pockets are only limited by the wearer’s imagination, as a good tailor can create specialty pockets sized to hold a variety of useful items.
In today’s world of technology, such pockets provide the perfect place to store items like cell phones and iPods.
Moving on from pockets we find the vents, flap-like slits in the bottom of the jacket which accommodate movement and offer easy access to the trouser pockets. Men’s suit jackets have three styles: center, side, or none.
Ventless suit jackets, just as the name implies, have no vents, and are popular on Continental suits; they provide a very sleek look to the back of the jacket, though they can lead to wrinkling when the wearer sits down. Center-vented jackets, very popular on American suits, have a single slit at the back, allowing the jacket to expand at the bottom when sitting.
Because of its placement, center-vented jackets have a habit of exposing the wearer’s posterior, though most seem not to mind, as center vents remain the most popular style. A side-vented jacket has two vents, one on either side, generally just behind the trouser pockets, to provide easy access.
Side vents also facilitate sitting more easily, moving as needed to prevent the rumpling of the jacket back, which leads to creasing.
A last bit of trimming concerns the lapels. Most jacket lapels include a button hole on the left lapel, roughly an inch below the gorge, which is generally sewn shut.
On very high quality jackets, there will be a corresponding button on the right lapel, though this is merely an element of style, as the lapels of a suit jacket are never turned up in the manner of a military uniform.
On most any suit, the buttonhole can be opened, and on the very best, there will be a small fabric loop on the underside of the left lapel, just below the buttonhole.
This is to facilitate the boutonnière, a small flower worn on the lapel, though the practice is generally confined to important participants in special occasions, e.g. the groom and groomsmen at a wedding or dignitaries at a memorial service.
Anyone choosing to wear a boutonnière on a regular basis is making a bold-yet-elegant choice.
Thus we finish our study of the suit jacket, though there is still a great deal to be learned about suit color, suit pattern, suit fabric, all of which we shall address in their own in-depth discussions.

Formality of a Light Gray Suit
Construction of Light Gray Suits
Fitting the Light Gray Suit
Matching Light Gray with Color and Pattern
What Man Needs A Light Gray Suit?
Importance of Owning a Light Gray Suit
The majority of men’s suits are made in dark colors.
Darker suits are more formal, and often easier to match shirts and ties with.
Most businesses that still require suits and ties every day specifically require dark suits, while the offices that once saw lighter suits in daily use have gone to slacks-and-shirtsleeves dress codes as standards relax.
This leaves light suits as a predominantly casual wardrobe option — and a perennial favorite of sharp-dressed men who take advantage of the lighter shades’ rarities.
Light gray is the most versatile of all the light colors, and holds a special place in the wardrobe of any sophisticated suit-wearers.
The line between “light gray” and “medium gray” can be difficult to draw, but a good rule of thumb is that any shade a white pinstripe would stand out against is medium gray.
At the point where white threads are disappearing into the overall color, the gray is true light gray. The thread should still be visible after a moment’s inspection or up close, of course — a true white suit is a completely different creature, and men have no business wearing anything that could be mistaken for one outside of a wedding or a disco.
Light gray suits are casual wear. They do not belong in conservative offices that still adhere to strict business-dress standard. A man could wear one in a workplace that does not require suits and ties, but should understand the formal limitations of lighter colored suiting.
In fact – versatility wise – he might be better served with a sport jacket and odd trousers at that point. A light gray suit is something to wear to dinner, out dancing, or just around the town on a day off.
Light gray suits are rarely patterned. Patterning reduces the formality further, to the point that a sport jacket and odd trousers would make more sense than a matched suit of such aggressively informal design.
When it is done, light gray suits are usually patterned with darker threads, typically in pinstripes or faint plaids and checks. These are borderline novelty garments, most commonly seen on entertainers and cultivated eccentrics.
Light gray is a popular color in warmer climates, making lightweight wools and cotton a natural choice for light gray suits.
“Tropical weight” wool may actually work better than cotton for a suit coat in humid climates — wool wicks moisture away from its wearer and resists saturation much better than cotton if it is not woven for the heat (seersucker is an example of cotton woven the right way for heat).
Even lightweight wools still have a natural drape that also make them ideal for menswear, falling smoothly down the body without seeming too sculpted or too flowing.
Summer and tropical suits are also often made of linen. This natural fiber is much lighter than wool, and tends to billow on its own.
Dyed linen tends to have a very flat, matte appearance as compared to the more lustrous wool.
Cotton is a distant third material, occasionally woven in lightweight twills to make affordable suits, but these tend to wear and stain easily, and lack the breathability and water resistance of wool or linen.
Again – seersucker is the best way to wear a cotton suit in light gray – but light grey seersucker suits are the realm of custom clothiers thanks to their demand by only men who truly understand their benefits.
Heavier suits in light gray are rarer, and almost always wool flannel. Many are more casual versions of the “Man in the Gray Flannel Suit” business classic — dressed-down adaptations of traditional mid-20th century menswear.
They tend to feature soft, napped wool and untapered “sack” jackets. Good quality wool flannel makes these extremely comfortable garments, excellent for prolonged wear on a weekend or evening out in the fall or a sunny winter day.
Like any suit, light gray outfits should hang close to the body without billowing. The suit should never be tight enough to pinch or wrinkle at any point, but men want to avoid excess fabric that waves or flaps when their body moves.
Lighter colors can be particularly susceptible to a “breezy” impression; a closer fit helps keep them looking trim and flattering.
Light gray is strictly a single-breasted jacket color. The formality of a double-breasted suit jacket or three-piece suit would look silly in such a casual shade.
Even a three-button or 3/2 style jacket may be pushing it — two buttons, low down on the body, are the best option for a light gray suit. The deep “V” shape and good expanse of shirtfront emphasizes the relaxed nature of the garment.
A single-breasted, two-button jacket in a casual color like light gray can be worn without a necktie without looking incomplete, something of a rarity in matched suits.
Like its darker cousins medium and charcoal gray, a light gray suit has no opposites on the color wheel. It is simply a shade of black.
That doesn’t mean that nothing will clash — any color in a shade of similar lightness will look like a mismatch with light gray. No, what there needs to be is a clear distinction between how close the gray is to white and how close the colors worn with it are to the same point.
Deep colors help make the contrast clear, as do patterns. Plain white shirts will usually be too close to light gray to be a good match, and should be broken up with a pattern of some kind, ideally in a dark color.
A patterned gray suit is an ambitious sartorial challenge. Pinstripes in a dark color can be an interesting inversion of traditional business-wear (dark gray with light-colored pinstripes), but dress shirts then need to avoid clashing with both the light gray and the color of the stripe.
Plaid in such a light color looks odd, and big windowpane checks on a light color is aggressively retro — one of those looks better left in the 1970s. Texture in the fabric can make a less jarring alternative to a pattern in a dark color and help emphasize that the suit is light gray rather than off-white.
Light gray suits are ideal for men who wear suits by choice or have all of the foundation suits covered.
Men who wear suits out of business necessity will want to opt for darker colors and more conservative choices; men who want to look sharp when they go out socially can wear light grays with confidence. The color will stand out as a consciously-thought choice rather than a default style.
Men in hot, humid climates will also want to think about investing in a light gray suit – especially one that is unlined and made from a lightweight fabric. Dress codes in general tend to relax as the thermometer climbs, meaning that a light gray suit might be a more useful piece of business wear than it would be for a man in a temperate climate. And the color will certainly be more comfortable to wear on social occasions than most other options.
At the end of the day, light gray isn’t a suit that every man needs — but it’s a color than nearly any man can look good in if he wants to. Adding a light gray suit to the closet gives you a powerful tool for social occasions and a unique chance to stand out in a crowd."
https://atailoredsuit.com/how-dress-engineer-interview.html,"“Engineering” is a broad term that can apply to jobs ranging from digging ditches to advanced statistical analysis.
Engineers write code; they also build bridges.
And they interview for all those jobs, making the process varied, challenging, and potentially much harder to dress for than a doctor or lawyer’s interview.
Applying for a job with a major engineering form can take multiple visits of multiple days each, or it can be a forty-five minute all-or-nothing chance to impress.
This article makes recommendations for each situation, and picks out the constant standards running through all versions of the engineering interview as well.
Before we go into specifics, it’s important to touch on the common engineering ethos.
It’s something of a generalization to say that engineers are unimpressed by non-functional aesthetics, but the generalization makes a handy guideline when dressing for interviews.
Employers are less likely to be impressed by fashionable flourishes than they might be at a law firm or a financial office.
Dressing practically will count for a lot, and dressing impractically may be a stroke against you even if the effect would normally be considered a flattering one.
To that end, you will want your interview clothes to express functionality. This may mean keeping things visually streamlined, but it can also mean incorporating details that evoke hands-on work.
And it will certainly mean paying attention to the practical tools you carry with you — no one should be showing up at an engineering interview without a pen and a mechanical pencil in the pocket, even if it’s not a hands-on part of the application process.
At their most traditional, interviews are still sit-down exchanges between a prospective employee and a hiring manager of some kind.
They can range from single sit-downs to prolonged visits, but in either case your appearance is part of the evaluation.
It makes the first impression and the last one.
Appearing at an interview well turned-out is more than a superficial gesture — it shows an awareness of standards and an ability to adapt to them, which is as much a job skill as any drafting or mathematical technique, and it demonstrates attention to detail and an ability to do the basic research for a project.
An interview suit should be simple, conservative, and restrained. No one is likely to hold an overly-subdued style against an applicant, the same cannot be said for flashier styles.
The standard business suit in America is a single-breasted, two-button model with notched lapels, most traditionally done in black, charcoal gray, or navy blue.
We caution strongly against deviating too far on any of these points in the primary interview suit — there’s lots of room for stylistic innovation in other wardrobe staples, but stick to the basics for job interviews, especially first meetings and formal sit-down interviews.
There’s no reason to cut corners on a suit that’s representing you to employers — find something in a good wool with enough weight to ensure a clean drape.
A small amount of other fibers in the blend is perfectly acceptable, and may even give your suit some added durability, but avoid anything with a high percentage of synthetic fiber, or anything that has a slickly smooth sheen to it. The matte finish of good wool gives a neat drape and a restrained personal effect that projects neatness and tidiness at an interview.
A suit that doesn’t fit at all the key points is a suit that’s making you look silly in at least one place.
You can’t really afford even small gaffes at a high-stakes interview, so have your suit adjusted if it wasn’t tailored to your measurements in the first place: the sleeves should fall to the base of the wrist and leave 1/2″ or so of shirt cuff visible, the lapels should lie flat when the jacket is buttoned (which should not cause any pinching or bunching at the waist), and the bottom end of the jacket should fall far enough to cover the curve of your bottom.
The collar should lie flat against your neck, with 3/4″ or so of shirt collar showing above it.
As with any clothing measurements, the best judge of fit will always be trying the suit on. Make sure that it rests without pinching or bunching even when you move, and that the fabric is not loose enough to fold or billow on its own. Anything that causes discomfort or unattractive wrinkling should be fixed before any interviews.
The most formal option in men’s business wear is a plain white shirt with a well-pressed, non-button-down collar. It’s always a safe option for an interview, though hardly the only appropriate one — use it as your baseline rather than your absolute standard.
Bright colors or bold patterns would be inappropriate for an interview, but some subtle elements in either area help make a conservative outfit more unique without appearing frivolous.
If you opt for a white shirt, consider a subtle texturing to make it more eye-catching. A herringbone weave in plain white is much more interesting to the eye than untextured monochrome.
Modest patterning is also appropriate, especially on a primarily white base; small, regularly-sized checks in light blue — with their visual nod to graph and drafting paper — are particularly worthwhile for engineers.
In an interesting reversal of the usual business preferences, engineers may find employers more willing to accept button-down collars and less inclined to look favorably on French cuffs.
The former have both a practicality and a traditional association with manual labor that go over well in most engineering firms, while the latter are a purely fashionable gesture that can get in the way of work with the hands.
A tie is really only needed for the sit-down parts of the interview process, and may actually be a hindrance for other aspects.
This doesn’t make your tie selection unimportant — in fact, it makes it more important, since you’ll likely only be displaying one tie, or two or three in the most prolonged applications.
Try for a restrained pattern rather than an unbroken monochrome, especially if your suit is a solid color.
The most important rule with patterns is to wear patterns of different sizes and scales; don’t match a narrowly-striped shirt with a narrowly-striped tie.
Tie clips or chains are another adornment that would usually be considered excessive or inappropriate but may be seen as acceptable and even admirable by engineering supervisors.
If you’re uncertain, slip one in your pocket and have it on hand to attach if a tour of a facility goes out onto a mechanized floor, or an interview includes a meal.
You want to keep the visual clutter to a minimum during your formal interview, and at all stages of the hiring process in general, so opt for a pair of black Oxfords without tips or edging of any kind.
A good shine the day before the interview should leave the leather smooth but not overly reflective — you don’t want to appear overly flashy, and institutional lighting tends to lend itself to glare.
Socks — a minor issue, but a relevant one — should be matched to the color of your trousers, not the color of your shoes.
That prevents your leg from looking shortened if the trouser cuff rides up. They should also be free of holes, even where you think no one will see them, since there’s always the unlikely-but-real possibility that you’ll enter a facility with specialized footgear and need to change in front of others.
The full suit is the best-bet default for most interviews, however occasionally hiring managers will specifically mention that there’s no need to wear a suit.
A dress shirt or even a polo and slacks are fairly standard in engineering culture these days, so an interviewer may simply want to set the tone of the firm up front, or the request may stem from a physical need.
If the interview includes a visit to a job site or some other form of hands-on activity, a full suit is certainly not the most practical option.
The caution to keep in mind with a “no suit” interview is that you’re trying to avoid looking like every other man at the firm.
You may end up spending your workdays in blue button-down shirts and khakis if you get hired, but wearing that outfit to the interview tells the hiring manager that you’re interchangeable, which means replaceable, which means not the best investment for his budget.
Sport coats are a powerful tool for dressing up an unmatched outfit, and should always be your non-suit interview default unless there’s a safety concern prohibiting any loose garments (or, of course, if you’re specifically told not to wear a jacket for any reason).
Regardless of the corporate culture you’re stepping into, the shape of a well-fitted jacket will make you look more streamlined and balanced than a shirt alone can; if you’re truly worried about looking overdressed, opt for a lighter color or even a subtly patterned fabric in the jacket.
Vertical striping or a muted check can make it clear that you’re wearing a coat as part of your personal style rather than as a concession to a culture your employers are trying to distance themselves from.
A good sport coat can also be worn without a tie, so long as the dress shirt beneath is of good quality and the collar is not spread so far that its tips disappear under the jacket lapels when the collar button is undone.
The lower half of an unmatched outfit requires just as much thought as the upper.
Dark wool or cotton slacks are ideal — jeans are too informal, and khakis are so ubiquitous in business casual attire that you’ll just blend right back into the herd.
Neutral grays, browns, or blacks are easy to work with, and give you the  option of a restrained combination or a brighter, more aggressively casual palette, depending on which seems called for.
Shoes should stay reasonably conservative, though you can wear brown rather than black if it matches better; be sure to change belts as well so that the two leather items match.
Final Preparations for your Engineering Interview
Whatever the overall dress code, keep the engineering focus in mind and pay attention to details of preparedness.
Wear a watch so that you don’t have to fish your phone out to check the time. Some firms will be completely computerized, but have a pen and a mechanical pencil in your inner jacket pocket for the ones that aren’t.
Get a good haircut or at least a trim around the ears and neck a couple days before the interview, and make sure you’re showered and scrubbed.
Avoid cologne or strongly-scented aftershave, particularly if you’re going to be in any kind of small spaces; just soap and a mild deodorant is more than enough.
Remember the basic ethos here — function balanced with form is going to win the approval from hiring managers."
https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-sport-jacket-why-wear.html,"It seems that fewer and fewer men wear suits to work, but everyone still judges you by your appearance.
In a business casual office, the sport coat will give you a dignified, trustworthy look without appearing out of place.
You can even hang it on your chair for most of the day, donning it to attend a meeting or go out to lunch.
Self-employed men know especially how important it is to make a good first impression, and the sport coat is a sure way to do that.
Whether you are an accountant, IT technician, or piano tuner, this brilliantly versatile jacket will elevate you in your clients’ eyes whatever you wear it with (well, almost).
If you’re not going to wear a suit, there’s simply no better way to dress respectably.
Thanks to both its stylish and practical versatility, the sportcoat is the uniform of choice for men whose jobs take them from office to construction site, loading dock, or factory floor.
While the hallowed suit-and-tie look can appear out of place outside the business district these days, the sport coat can go anywhere.
Teachers, independent retailers, and professional counselors find it a boon to the friendly, while distinguished presentation their vocations invite.
For play clothes, the rules are a little different but the basic idea is the same: you want to look good without standing out.
The omnipresence of the jacket with collar and lapels across all sorts of men’s clothing is no accident: this configuration is aesthetically pleasing whether in a tailcoat or a safari jacket.
The sport coat brings the concept to a garment that’s comfortable and easy going, perfect for the weekend.
In the United States, comfort reigns tyrannically over leisure clothing, and some men worry about looking sufficiently relaxed wearing a jacket when off duty.
Social concerns aside, a man is simply more attractive in a sport coat than in a sweatshirt, and this fact should encourage those who fear drawing accusations of looking “uptight” if they wear anything they can’t play basketball in.
The sheer beauty of tailored clothing transcends this country’s present obsession with being laid back.
There are many who take pride in their appearance at all times, and these will have a closet full of carefully chosen jackets in a variety of fabrics and colors.
Wearing sport coats, however, does not necessarily mean owning a large wardrobe. With a blue blazer alone, you can create a huge variety of outfits for all manner of occasions.
Add jackets of Harris tweed and herringbone, and you could be ready for just about anything.
If you’re on the go a lot, your jacket can be a virtual bat-belt, holding papers, pens, phone, PDA, keys, cigarettes, wallet, and loose cash all secure and readily accessible. Almost all sport coats have the standard two inside pockets; many have additional ones for pens or cash.
A custom made coat can have whatever pocket configuration its wearer desires, such as special pockets for a security badge, pocket watch, or cigar.
Men have even had their jackets made with an iPod pocket, complete with a port for the headphone wire. While some claim that putting anything in a jacket’s outside pockets throws its drape askew and should be avoided, this can usually be remedied by load-balancing: keys on the right, phone on the left, etc.
The inside pockets can hold significant weight without affecting how the fabric hangs, but whatever you put in them will be right against your chest with the jacket closed, so it’s not the best place for a bulky key-chain.
The sport coat is a remarkably versatile garment. It is the working man’s suit and the thinking man’s pullover. In this twenty-first century, it guarantees its wearer a sharp, handsome look wherever he goes."
https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-sports-jacket-about.html,"Anytime you find yourself wondering what to wear–to a party, a meeting, or a date–a sport coat will likely be the answer.
You will know when you need to wear a suit, and you likewise know when a tee-shirt and shorts are okay.
Stylish and relaxed, the sport coat covers much of the vast gulf between.
For most situations in an American man’s life, the sport coat is a superb choice for composing a look that’s both attractive and appropriate.
Today’s sport coat carries a mixed ancestry from the days when men didn’t go outside their homes without a jacket and tie.
In the late nineteenth century, the English gentleman wore a brown tweed jacket in the country to hunt foxes on horseback or shoot birds; it was back vented and bore large, slanted pockets.
In the cricket and rowing clubs closer to town, batsmen and crew members sported uniforms of single-breasted blazers in their clubs’ colors.
The double-breasted navy-blue blazer was first worn on a British frigate in 1837, by sailors dressing to impress the visiting queen.
In Europe and America between the world wars, the various sport coats that these nineteenth century jackets begat took hold of leisure fashion and haven’t let go since.
A man in the market for a sport coat today has a wealth of options for customizing it.
As has been said elsewhere, the classic blue blazer goes with anything, and a sport coat in some gray or brown pattern is nearly as versatile. Many men keep such a jacket in the office to act as a dress up/dress down switch.
And then there is leisure. Today’s lack of established standards of dress for different social occasions leaves many fretting about what to wear to a dinner party, concert, or afternoon reception.
The worry is compounded if you don’t know your host well, and even more so if you’re hoping to make a good impression with someone there. Once again, the sport coat comes to the rescue. It originated as a leisure garment, remember, and today does the job as well as ever.
If someone has invited you to their home, church, club, or anywhere really, it is a sign of respect to take care in your appearance upon arriving.
Even if nobody else is wearing a jacket when you get there, people will appreciate that you made the effort. If you feel too out of place, you can always take it off, but the truly stylish man knows that he can achieve casualness with his words and manners while maintaining dignity in his dress.
Nor can a man be too young to look good in a jacket. At a night club or a party, a sport coat in charcoal or off-white with slacks or designer jeans is a tough look to beat. For the young man who is not yet concerned with dressing up for work, one or two decent sport coats will make it easy to look sharp for any occasion.
They will be a better investment than anything the trend-hawkers have to offer, since proper tailoring and classic patterns will never go out of style.
I could go on, but I believe I have made my point. The sport coat, especially a custom tailored one, is rarely out of place and always looks good. It’s what you wear when you’re not sure what to wear, or when you want to dress better but don’t know where to start."
https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-sports-jacket-differences-suit-jacket.html,"Why the Confusion?
A Brief Overview of Both Jackets
Suit Jacket – Business & Special Occasion
Sport Jacket – Casual Opportunities
Conclusion – Each has a Place
Why the confusion between Sport Jacket and Suit Jackets?
The confusion between sport jackets and suit jackets is a more modern problem.
Fifty years ago most men wore and understood the rules of wearing a suit, and a sport jacket was just that – a jacket for sport worn when the season and situation warranted a suit inappropriate.
Today with so few of us wearing a suit daily and even less of us having been explained the guidelines of menswear – many men find themselves wondering, just what is the difference and why can’t they be interchangeable?
Give me 5 minutes, and I’ll show you the light my friend.
A Brief Overview of Both Jackets
While the suit jacket is governed by the conservative specifications of the suit, the sports jacket knows no such bounds.
Its similar cut still flatters the body and frames the face, but its independence invites a broad range of outfits for myriad situations.
The odd jacket–a term for any jacket that’s not part of a suit, generally a blazer jacket or sport coat–originated as leisure wear and remains as such, while today’s loosened standards of professional attire now make it also the garment of choice for many who would have worn suits twenty years ago.
The Suit Jacket – Business and Special Occasion Wear
The suit jacket has evolved over several centuries into a garment that looks great on any man.
Depending on its cut, it may add weight to the body or subtract it; it may elongate the frame or compress it.
The triangle formed by the lapels draws the eye towards the head, while leaving room for something more colorful to cast the face in its best light.
Besides the traditional suit-and-tie regiment, a suit of solid color has few other possibilities. Worn without a tie it makes a great outfit for New Years Eve, but looks awkward at the office.
The coat can be worn with dress slacks of a different color, with or without a tie, but this requires some care. If executed poorly–and this is purely aesthetic–a suit jacket without its matching pants looks incongruous and sloppy.
Additionally, when you dry clean a suit jacket or wear it in the sun while its matching pants hang in your closet, you run the risk that the fabrics will fade differently and the suit will cease to match.
A dark suit jacket over sneakers, t-shirt and jeans is de rigeur in the entertainment business, but like pyrotechnics and car chases this one is best left to the professionals.
Solids aside, such patterns as chalk stripe and windowpane are called suit fabrics for a reason; leave them to do what they do best.
The Sport Jacket – Endless Casual Opportunities
On the other hand, the outfits possible with an odd jacket run the gamut of formality and monopolize its vast middle ground.
Consider the navy blue classic with brass buttons. Worn with gray slacks, black shoes, a white button-down shirt and a classy tie, it holds its own in a room full of suits. Throw in a pocket square to complete the ensemble and you’re dressed better than half of the more conservatively clad men.
Lose the tie and slip into your khakis, and you have a sharp outfit that can go anywhere without drawing attention to itself. Toss an odd jacket on over your chinos and polo shirt, and you look classy but not dressed up.
The possibilities are endless; the only caveat here is to avoid pants too close in color to the coat itself.
Without the constraints implied by matching trousers, odd jacket fabrics range from the staid navy wool to camel hair, madras, corduroy and plaid.
These may be finished with low-key horn or plastic buttons, or they may fasten with brass or nickel. Besides the slit and flap pockets common to suits, sporty patch pockets are an option here.
When there’s no tie in the picture, it falls to the jacket to finish the outfit; interesting fabrics and contrasting hardware help it rise to the occasion. Thanks to its history as sportswear, the odd jacket is generally looser fitting than a suit coat to allow for ease of movement.
Conclusion – The Suit Jacket and Sport Jacket each has a place in a Man’s Wardrobe
Although the suit has been put on a pedestal that makes it impractical for many men on many days, the odd jacket carries its aesthetic heritage over to a garment for the masses.
Both jackets have their place in a man’s wardrobe, and each should be worn in the situation that best suits their nature."

Business Interviews and Jewelry
Business Interviews and Grooming
A business school level interview is very different from your run-of-the-mill job screening.
Business school interviews are drawn out events that can involve three or more interviews & meetings in multiple cities with up to a six of your peers and interviewers.
Companies at this level are paying well into six figures, and they want to make sure you have the skills they want and are a great fit for their company culture.
Strangely, very little is covered at top business schools as to how to dress for business school interviews.
As a former student I was always surprised to see people spending 100K on their education yet wearing cheap suits and scuffed shoes to an interview.
People make a judgment about you within 3 seconds; they then spend the rest of the time rationalizing this quick assessment.
In other words it is very difficult to overcome a bad first impression. So why shoot yourself in the foot when with a little bit of planning and investment you can turn your appearance into an asset.
Failing to prepare for an Interview is tantamount to preparing to fail 
Behind every successful business school interview is time spent in preparation. Study the company you are going to interview with and pay attention to their unstated dress code.
Most likely you have met a few of their employees; how did they present themselves? Were they conservative or relaxed in the appearance?
Interviewing with Citibank is different than interviewing with Google’s marketing department; both will require a suit, but with Google it’s safe to say you can wear a less conservative color and maybe throw in a white pocket square.
The good news for the business school student is that the classical men’s suit style has remained the same for a hundred years.
The bad news is that there are a lot of fashion suits out there that become dated faster than you can purchase them. The key here is to ignore fleeting fashion and rather seek understand what your timeless style is.
This may sound complicated but it’s not. Just remember three things when choosing a men’s suit – Fabric, Style, and Fit.
When selecting a fabric for an business school interview suit, take into consideration the fabric’s weave and overall construction.
Try to go with a natural suit fabric such as worsted wool. A blend is acceptable, but make sure it’s of high quality and there isn’t a reflective quality to the fabric – although blends keep the price down they usually do not last as long and have a tendency to breathe less.
As to color choice, the most common and therefore safest selections are navy blue, charcoal, and black. Although you can move outside these three if this is not a first or second suit with a pattern (navy blue pin stripes, bird’s eye, or a medium gray fabric are all excellent selections), make sure you understand your attire will stick out.
When it comes to men’s suit style, go with a classical cut.
In the United States this is a single breasted, notched lapel, 2 or 3 button jacket with a single or double back vent and regular flap pockets.
Ensure you have at least as many cuff buttons as you have front jacket buttons (4 buttons on the sleeve is normal) and ensure you have a left breast pocket.
Take a close look at the lapels: a trend right now is thin lapels; avoid this fashion fad as that you want to wear this suit in a year (and 5 years from now for that matter).
With your trousers, depending on your build you want either flat or pleated fronts.
If you are taller than six feet, consider going with a cuffed bottom.
Finally, inspect the jacket and trousers for quality construction by tugging on the buttons, inspect the sewing, pulling on the seams.
Most men’s suits are too large in one area or another. Try to find a brand whose factory cut matches your build and then find a tailor who can ensure your attire fits properly.
For a perfect fit you want your suit jacket’s sleeves (when standing) to show 1 inch of cuff, its lapels should lay flat, an “X” from tightness doesn’t appear when buttoned, make sure the jacket’s shoulders do not extend past yours, that jacket covers your backside but isn’t so long you can’t grab it with your hands when standing straight, and finally make sure that no bunches form in the back near your neck collar (which should lay flat and show ¾ inch of shirt collar).
Dress shirts come in a wide variety of colors and weaves, and their effect on an outfit should not be underestimated.
A pink striped herringbone dress shirt can turn an ordinary charcoal men’s suit into an outfit that demands attention while a conservative white broadcloth dress shirt can tone down a striped suit’s allure.
Choosing a unique fabric weave (such as a twill or herringbone) in a conservative color is a great way to retain your individuality while not making to much noise with your clothing ensemble.
Conservatively colored patterned shirts are another way to break the mold without offending. Although they lower the formability of the outfit, a patterned shirt with a conservative tie is a safe bet on a second or third interview.
Two parts of your shirt will be showing when you wear a jacket; the collar and cuffs. The collar should be chosen based off of your facial structure.
Men with long, thin faces should go with a spread while round faced men should look to even out their face with point collars.
Normal barrel cuffs with one or two buttons are fine for all interviews; you may be tempted to wear cufflinks to your interview with an investment bank, but be careful.
Some interviewers view this display of cuff jewelry as obnoxious; however, if you normally wear this type of cuffs by all mean be yourself.
As to fit, you should be able to put two fingers in-between your neck and a buttoned collar. Your sleeves and cuffs should extend to the top of your hands, and you want to show approximately 1 inch of shirt cuff from under your jacket sleeve.
A conservative selection here is the best bet for the business school interview necktie. Red, gold, blue….the color is less important that the fact that it should just complement the outfit.
You can stand out of the crowd by choosing a tie with a simple repeating pattern, but again try to keep it subtle. Striped ties are a good choice, but be aware as to whether it is a regimental tie or not.
In countries such as England, memberships to certain military clubs are symbolized by striped tie design; you do not want to find yourself in a situation having to explain why you are wearing another man’s regimental colors.
Unless you are going to be eating (where it serves to hold the tie in place), there is no reason to use a tie clip or tie pin in an business school interview. And it should go without saying that anything with hula girls, Santa Claus, or reflective colors that can be seen at night should be avoided.
For business school interviews we recommend a plain black Oxford.
They feature round toes, sometimes with a cap and either closed or open lacing.
Plain cap-toe Oxfords are the most formal option for business wear, and can do double-duty as formal shoes.
Oxfords with broguing along the cap’s edge, or trimming the uppers, are still formal enough for a business school interview in the United States.
Avoid slip-ons, whether they are loafers, boots, or monkstraps.
Although these are perfectly fine for a business casual luncheon (and are great for travel!), in a formal interview you are best advised to wear a timeless pair of classic Oxfords.
For a detailed overview of men’s dress shoes – click here.
Yes, I just know you were waiting for me to cover this topic.
While not terribly exciting, your socks are a detail that should not be overlooked. They should match your slacks or shoes and be preferably dark in color.
The goal is to not draw attention; if the socks are seen, they should appear to flow seamlessly between the shoes and trousers. Also make sure they are high enough that you do not expose your bare legs when adjusting in your chair.
Wedding rings are always acceptable in an business school interview; however anything else is fair game and is left up to the interviewer’s personal views on this matter.
A class ring from Annapolis or Texas A&M may give you a leg up if your interviewer is an Alumni or you’re in Houston, Texas. But it just as easily could stereotype you if the person interviewing has a chip on their shoulder.
Nose rings, eye piercings, and earrings are making their way into the corporate scene, but each of these adornments still send a message to the interviewer.
Be yourself, but be aware that you cannot wear these pieces of jewelry without it affecting a person’s impression of you.
As for watches in an interview, keep it simple. No alarm should be set or active (leave digital at the gym), and it should not scream I have 25K on my wrist (leave the diamond studded Rolex at home).
Ensure your interview watch fits and doesn’t slide around like a bracelet. A simple watchpiece with a leather band is my personal favorite, but in the US a metallic band is just as acceptable.
Get a haircut a few days before your business school interview and go to someone who has been cutting your hair for a while; a bad haircut isn’t something you want to worry about.
Even if you don’t need a haircut get at least a trim around the neck and ears. Invest in a nail brush and thoroughly clean your nails (no grime underneath); they should be cut neatly as well.
Finally, avoid cologne; a shower, deodorant, and a neutral smelling aftershave lotion are all you need; anything else is could be overwhelming to the senses in a small closed room."
https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-pocket-squares-make.html,"Pocket squares come in a variety of colors and patterns.
These are appropriate to most ensembles, and should be chosen to contrast with the shirt and tie while still being set off against the color of the jacket.
What one should look for in a pocket square is coordinated contrast.
That is to say, a combination of pattern and fabric that is different than the suit, shirt, and tie, but not so unlike as to clash.
Perhaps the most classic dress handkerchief is the solid white square, made of linen or cotton. Depending on the chosen fold, it may be lightly starched to provide body.
The white square is acceptable for almost any ensemble but looks particularly good with dark, conservative suits where its crisp clean appearance is most pronounced.
Silk squares are what a gentleman is most likely to encounter in the department store; many have dozens of options on display.
These handkerchiefs come in nearly every color and pattern imaginable, and offer far more opportunity to make a bold and distinctive statement.
By the same token, these are also the handkerchiefs that produce much of the stress associated with wearing a square, as the variety of colors and patterns presents what can seem a daunting choice.
One particular detail to note when choosing a silk square are hand-rolled edges; these are a sign of quality and attention to detail and should be present on a well-made square.
Remember when selecting the type of fabric for a dress handkerchief, the fabric of the jacket and tie should be considered. Mix silk squares with heavier tie fabrics, and more textured handkerchiefs with smooth ties is an excellent way to add contrast, while silk squares against a rough jacket like tweed is particularly distinctive.
Wool suits, the most common option, are equally at home with linen or silk, as are silk ties – indeed, the variety of patterns available in silk may require a silk square for some ensembles.
In choosing pattern for a square, one should look to the most brightly colored or patterned item in the ensemble. In most cases, this will be the tie, though should it be the shirt, or even in some cases the suit itself, that element should be given focus.
One has nearly every color and pattern to choose from, though this will obviously be constrained by the examples available in ones wardrobe. With solid ensembles, patterns are particularly distinctive, and while solid squares may seem a safer choice for patterned ties, a contrasting patterned square provides a very elegant look.
As for color, it’s best to determine the base color for whatever item is being matched then opt for a complementing color. Also, it is best not to match the square directly to a prominent color; instead, match it to a secondary color as an accent.
As with everything else in classic style, the choice of color should also be mindful of the occasion; though it is only a few inches of visible material, a boldly colored square might well be out of place at a funeral or wedding."
https://atailoredsuit.com/how-dress-medical-interview.html,"We tend to think of hospitals as uniformed places — nurses in scrubs, doctors in coats, and so on.
But different institutions often use different dress codes, and can require varying levels of formality depending on the circumstances.
Even practicing surgeons rarely spend their whole day in sterile garb. “Office hours” have their requirements as well.
For the interviewing medical professional, this can be nerve-racking.
The medical industry is a wealthy and expensive one, and potential employees have to look like the absolute best possible investment their salary and benefits can buy.
With more doctors entering the workforce every year, there’s no excuse for coming to a medical job interview looking anything less than perfect.
Whether we like it or not, the hiring process is as much a purchasing decision as ordering a new MRI machine for the hospital.
Employers are looking for the best candidate their money can buy, and even a stellar résumé or transcript doesn’t complete that picture.
As superficial as it sounds, an attractively-dressed applicant looks like a better investment and has an immediate advantage over a similar person who is not as well presented.
A neat appearance suggests good attention to detail at the very least, and dressing up for an interview shows the employer that you understand the need to make an extra effort for special situations.
Even minor flaws in your outfit — a rumpled shirt, say, or scuffed shoes — screams of either inflexibility or outright cluelessness to a picky employer.
The best custom suit in the world will not, of course, get a job for a completely unqualified applicant. But turning out impeccably for an interview can make you stand out among equally-qualified applications as the candidate who understands the social necessities of the job as well as the medical skills — a rarer commodity on most hospital staffs than you might think.
And many potential employers are frankly just perplexed by poorly-dressed applicants, discarding them immediately. With educations in medicine routinely costing six figures, and salaries often commanding just as much, it’s hard to take someone in a badly-fitted, off-the-rack suit and beat-up shoes very seriously.
Most medical institutions have their own dress code, which you will want to significantly exceed for your interview.
Even if the interviewer tells you that a particular level of dress is appropriate, you may want to consider go slightly beyond that instruction.
A “let’s keep it casual” invitation should still be met with dress trousers, a collared shirt and tie, and a good jacket. Anything else is almost certainly suit and tie territory.
If you don’t happen to have access to a hospital’s dress code (they’re often on internal, employee-only systems), consider paying an informal visit to the grounds on your own time.
Sneak a peek at what the people in your position are wearing.
Somewhere with a wide variety of outfits, styles, and colors may be inclined toward an interviewer with a more aggressively modern presentation, while a hospital whose employees tend toward an unvarying dress code will clearly expect the most conservative, formal appearance you can muster.
You shouldn’t plan on looking like the hospital staff at your interview — you want to well exceed that level of dress — but you can form a good idea of how much individuality the administration prefers to see.
We use the phrase “interview suit” because it’s rarely appropriate for a male applicant in the medical field to wear anything but a full, matched suit.
Unless the interviewer very specifically instructs you to wear something else, the suit and tie is going to be the minimum expectation; wearing anything less is asking to be forgotten or even immediately discarded.
Interviews are enough of a high-stakes venture that we recommend a conservative approach, particularly if your budget only allows for one interview-and-work suit.
The basic single-breasted, two-button jacket with matching trousers is your safest and most multi-purpose garment, particularly in a dark gray or blue with minimal or no patterning. A white shirt and a sober tie make these suits appropriate for all levels of business wear, and therefore for an interview as well.
Keep the fit and presentation of your suit in mind as well as its basic cut and color. The shoulders of the jacket should end where your natural shoulders do, not hang off them, and the cuffs should stop high enough on the wrist to expose a half-inch or so of shirt cuff.
The trousers should be pressed, with a crisp crease and nothing large enough in the pockets to make an unsightly bulge. Freshly-shined black shoes are a must, with a matching belt unless you wear suspenders.
A good suit in a clean fit already gives you a leg up on your competition. Completing the look — adding the details — goes one step further and tells the viewer that you’re all about exceeding standards, rather than meeting them.
It’s hard to make a much better impression no matter what job you’re seeking. Look to impress with the touches that others tend to forget:
Like your outfit overall, none of the individual details are going to make or break an interview. What they can do is distinguish you as someone who thinks ahead, makes the extra effort in special circumstances, and understands the social expectations of the position as well as the medical knowledge needed.
With the medical profession so competitive and the opportunities a well put-together interview suit gives you, there’s no reason to appear anything less than your absolute best.

https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-suit-fabric-patterns.html,"Now that we’ve mastered suit color and picked out the basic suits that should be in every mans wardrobe, it’s time to begin thinking about adding patterns to the mix.
Patterned fabrics help bring a breath of fresh air into what can otherwise be a somewhat stilted selection of suits.
As one might expect, patterns are a bit more difficult than solid colors, and require more thought in their selection. As a general rule, patterns are less formal than solid colors, and so should be reserved for more relaxed occasions.
The exception to this rule is the pinstripe, which in all but the most formal cases is on par with any other dark colored suit, and indeed forms an integral part of certain kinds of formalwear.
The same is true of scale and constituent colors; large scale patterns are less formal than small scale ones, and bold, multicolored patterns are less formal than reserved, monochromatic ones.
With that out of the way, the first pattern to consider is the stripe. Stripes on suits are always vertical, but come in a number of different styles. The first, foremost, and most classic is the pinstripe.
A pinstriped suit, particularly a navy pinstriped suit, is an extremely traditional look, almost a uniform of sorts for the businessman.
Pinstripes, as the name suggests, are very narrow though generally prominent stripes, most often in white, although gray is a not-uncommon choice, especially on dark gray or black suits.
Occasionally one will find stripes in other colors – pastels were in vogue for a time – though these suits will quickly become dated once the fad has passed.
Additionally, they limit the opportunities for wear, being both informal and somewhat more difficult to match with shirt and tie. A classic, white pinstripe never goes out of style.
These, and all stripes, help to make the wearer appear taller, as they draw the face upwards, and can make a heavyset man appear thinner, by breaking up and drawing attention away from the solid midsection. This is particularly true for thin, close set stripes like the pinstripe.
There are also other stripes, including the thicker chalk stripe, as an option for the gentleman’s wardrobe.
These stripes, which are generally set farther apart due to their greater width, are significantly less formal than the pinstripe, and while continuing to provide the appearance of increased height, are less appropriate for large men, as they can draw attention to ones girth.
Moving on from the stripe is the check. Checks come in a number of different styles, though the best known among them is probably the plaid.
Plaid in American English is synonymous with tartan, the check patterns most closely associated with Scottish clans.
In British English, particularly in Scotland, plaid refers to a thick tartan cloth used both as a blanket and thrown over the shoulder when wearing a kilt.
What plaid is not synonymous with is check, which describes any fabric with crossing vertical and horizontal stripes.
With the exception of a legitimate Scottish tartan worn as part of a formal occasion, checks are always less formal than solids or stripes.
While tartans are arguably the most familiar checks to most individuals, Glen check is likely the most common for suits.
This check, often called Prince of Wales check, resembles a tartan, though it is primarily monochromatic.
It utilizes bands of vertical and horizontal stripes which, when viewed as a unit, create a wider check effect in the fabric.
Glen check has deep associations with the country and weekend wear – having been created for use by English nobles in Scotland who lacked a family tartan – though it is appropriate for most semi-formal occasions.
It may be frowned upon in certain professions with a particularly strict dress code, but should be an acceptable if not welcome divergence for most men.
Another check option is windowpane, a much more bold option where the stripes forming the check are far apart, creating a checkerboard effect.
Full windowpane suits are not frequently found anymore, though windowpane sports jackets may appear from time to time. A heavy dose of confidence and a certain amount of panache is required to carry off this kind of daring pattern.
A more subtle option is the herringbone, a small arrow-shaped pattern most often found in heavy woven fabrics like tweed.
Herringbone, like Glen check, is an appropriate pattern for most occasions, though because it usually adorns heavy fabrics, it is most often found on winter and country suits.
Similar is houndstooth, which somewhat resembles a saw-blade, a pattern far more common on sports jackets than full suits.
Somewhere between solids and stripes in formality is bird’s eye or nailhead, which examined closely has the appearance of tiny dots of a lighter color on a darker background.
A bird’s eye suit generally appears as a solid somewhere in between the two colors, similar to the effect of an Oxford cloth shirt.
Nail-head is appropriate in any occasion where stripes would be, and can be substituted for solids on all but the most formal of occasions.
There are a number of other patterns – bolder varieties of check, diagonals, argyle, paisley, Madras – though they are not to be found on suits, at least not on suits worn by a gentleman.
These are things to be considered in the realm of shirts, ties, and socks, which will be taken up in future, along with the true pattern art-form: matching two or more.
Windowpane suit features a much more bold option where the stripes forming the check are far apart, creating a checkerboard effect. The pattern can also be thicker and bolder, which makes more of a power statement. Full windowpane suits are not frequently found anymore, though windowpane sports jackets may appear from time to time. A heavy dose of confidence and a certain amount of panache is required to carry off this kind of daring pattern.
You're buying a suit for the first time. So not only does it have to fit you properly, it also has to represent you in the best possible light before you even start talking. That means having a solid grasp of the purpose behind your suit.
A bird’s eye suit generally appears as a solid somewhere in between the two colors, similar to the effect of an Oxford cloth shirt."
https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-double-breasted-suit-jacket.html,"Every coat that has a collar and lapels, whether sport coat, suit jacket, or overcoat, is either single-breasted or double-breasted.
The single-breasted construction is much more common, and consists of buttons on one edge and button holes on the other, meeting in a vertical line over the navel.
The double-breasted coat bears symmetrical sets of buttons on each side, with the left side folding over the right to be secured by one or two of them.
Single-breasted jackets are easy to find and look good on just about everyone.
Whether blazer or suit jacket, it can be made with two or three buttons, wide or narrow lapels, and high or low gorge, according to the particular needs of one’s body. For every man, there is a single-breasted configuration that is guaranteed to look handsome.
For this reason, the model as it has evolved over two-hundred years today holds the center-place of men’s style.
While the double-breasted coat demands a greater investment of time and effort to acquire and wear successfully, for many men the payoff is fantastic.
Since every man will own some single-breasted jackets and suits, the question of single or double-breasted is really a question of double-breasted or not. First, I shall consider its drawbacks; for those who remain undeterred I shall then recount its glories.
With an extra layer of fabric across the front and two rows of buttons, the double-breasted jacket is enough to drown a smaller man’s frame.
Those of narrow torso and shoulders will find it covers almost their entire chest, barely allowing the shirt and tie a glimpse of daylight.
Neither is it friendly to short men, as its bulk can diminish height.
The double-breasted suit is also more formal than the single-breasted, and is therefore less versatile. It is anachronistic over anything other than a conservative dress shirt and neck tie.
It looks ridiculous unbuttoned, and must therefore always stay closed, and this combined with its double-ply front can make it uncomfortable in the heat.
Finally, double-breasted suits have waned in popularity over the past half-century, and it is therefore quite difficult to find one that fits correctly.
Nevertheless, for the man who can wear it, the double-breasted suit provides a rare opportunity to don a more stylish garment without attracting undue attention.
To the casual observer a double-breasted suit differs little from a single-breasted one, but on closer examination it yields an older, more elegant look.
While it is indeed hard for most men to find one that looks really superb, when custom made its length, gorge height, button stance and lapel roll may each be selected to amplify a body’s virtues and distract from any shortcomings.
The double-breasted coat always sports peak lapels, and these contribute to its superior refinement. The original style has six buttons, with two to close.
While this suits tall men well, shorter men do better with a four- or six-button configuration in which only the bottom one closes (the four-button double-breasted jacket is sometimes called the “Kent,” after it’s supposed inventor the Duke of Kent).
The long, diagonal lines of lapels rolling to below the waist give the impression of height and downplay width. Indeed, a well-cut double-breasted jacket minimizes girth on all portly men, especially if it has broad shoulders to drape from.
The accessory rules when wearing a double-breasted suit are very similar to single-breasted suits. When it comes to neckwear, either a bow tie or neck tie can be worn.
However, the presence of no neckwear whatsoever is a definite style blunder, as that the double-breasted jacket’s formality by default demands something to adorn the neck.
A necktie’s width has always been determined by the jacket’s lapel, although with the double breasted jacket this can be difficult when they are wider than four and a half inches.
Average lapel widths range from 3.375 inches to 4.25 inches, with most double-breasted coat lapels leaning towards the later.
A necktie within the width range of 4 inches is always a safe bet.
More important than the width of the necktie however is the tie’s knot; with 70% of the tie hidden under a buttoned jacket, the knot takes center stage.
Be sure to pay attention when you compress the knot to form a strong inverted “V”.
With the tie knot’s proximity so close to your face, a blunder here will surely not go unnoticed.
Finally, carefully choose a pocket handkerchief that conveys the message you wish to send. With little shirt and tie showing, the breast pocket handkerchief will have a stronger effect than when it is worn with a single-breasted jacket.
For men who are tall, broad-shouldered, or both, the double-breasted suit is a boon to the wardrobe. The double-breasted blazer, too, is a brilliant way to do casual with flair.
While every man will own and wear single-breasted jackets, going double-breasted provides a special opportunity to broaden one’s sartorial horizons without straying from tradition."
https://atailoredsuit.com/how-to-build-custom-clothing.html,"Choosing a wardrobe that all works together.
One of the key ideas of the Style System is the idea of the interchangeable wardrobe. Simply put, this means a collection of clothes that work well with one another. It’s moving away from the idea of owning specific outfits and toward a look that mixes and matches.
Building an interchangeable wardrobe isn’t something you do in a weekend of shopping. It’s more of a mindset and a process to follow as you expand your wardrobe over the course of a lifetime:
Step 1: Inventory Your Closet
· Cut The Unsalvageable Items
· Keep and Repair the Best Pieces
· Repurpose Old Styles
Step 2: Build a Solid Core
· Know the “Core” Items
· Start with Timeless Styles
· Invest in Quality
Step 3: Expand with Style Pieces
· Define Your Personal Style
 · Expand Your Accent Options
· Add Pieces Over Time
This can be a scripted process or an organic one. Some people find it easiest to create a checklist of wardrobe “needs” and search for each item in turn. Other people prefer opportunistic shopping that fills gaps whenever a good item comes along. Both approaches are fine — the key thing is to keep the goal of interchangeability in mind and work on adding useful items to the wardrobe with each purchase. Step 1: Inventory Your Closet
You may be closer to owning an interchangeable wardrobe than you think, depending on what you have in the closet right now.
Even old clothes — worn, patched, or out of style — can end up serving a useful wardrobe purpose if they’re combined with the right things. Knowing what you already have to work with can be a good starting point for figuring out what you need to buy, and what styles will work for you.
Cut the Unsalvageable Items
Start with the most ruthless part: culling the wardrobe of dead weight.
Nearly all of us have things we’re keeping around out of habit rather than need. Old suits or coats that don’t fit, T-shirts with huge holes in them, mismatched socks — all of those can go.
It doesn’t seem like a huge step, but cleaning out the clutter is a big help in terms of both physical and psychological space. Practically, it opens up room for new clothing, and on a mental level it pares away bad options that you’re wasting brainpower considering and rejecting each time you check the closet.
Look for clothes that fit any of these categories, and consider dropping them in the Goodwill box:
· Bad Fit: Anything that’s too tight or too lose, and can’t be adjusted to a more appropriate fit.
· Worn Out: A ratty T-shirt or two for yardwork or the gym is worth having around, but any nicer clothes that are fraying at the edges or sporting holes should be set aside.
· Over-represented: Thin the ranks of anything that’s taking over your whole wardrobe. If you have a couple black turtlenecks, great; if you have a dozen of them, throw some out unless you’re Steve Jobs.
· Hopelessly Dated: Anything so dated that it’s only a costume piece can go. Be forgiving here, though — many out-of-style items come back into style, or can be repurposed as a more casual look, so only cull the most egregiously “period” pieces.
· Downright Useless: You know you own them — the mismatched socks, the belts with the broken buckles; the winter coats with the dead stuffing. Stop saving them as “back-ups” or in the hopes that you’ll re-use them and just pitch them.
This is a process that’s worth doing every couple of years as your wardrobe and your body change. If you’ve got plenty of storage space you can afford to be more forgiving that someone with limited closet room, but even a man with plenty of spare shelving benefits from having less bad choices lying around. Keep and Repair the Best Pieces
Sometimes pieces of clothing have fallen out of use because they don’t quite meet your current needs, or aren’t in perfect condition, but that doesn’t mean they’re automatically ready for the trash.
Take the time to identify what your best clothing pieces are, whether you wear them regularly or not. The sturdy workshirt you wear every week qualifies, but so does a good dark suit that you wear maybe once a year, so long as it’s in good shape and fits well.
Give these a cleaning and repair if they need it and keep them in circulation. They’re your best options right now, and it may be a while before anything replaces them as such. Even an old jacket or shirt can look great, so long as it’s well-fitted and any minor wear-and-tear is tidied up.
Repurpose Old Styles 
A few pieces of clothing are truly hopeless: polyester lounge suits, fringed bell-bottom jeans; knit sweaters with Christmas patterns. Most other garments can actually be repurposed, if it’s done carefully.
All that means is taking old items that you wouldn’t normally wear — a suit that’s too worn at the elbows and knees to be business-appropriate, say, or a T-shirt with a band logo that you still like but that hasn’t played for years — and putting it to a more casual or creative use.
Suit “separates,” for example (the individual pieces that make up a suit) can be worn long after the other pieces have fallen apart or stopped fitting. Wear the jacket with jeans and colored sneakers and it’s suddenly a fashion statement, rather than just a mismatched suit jacket.
Mix, match, repair, and patch as much as needed to keep things in circulation. Every once and a while you will come across an item that’s just not useful any more — but most of the time, if you pair it with something unusual or do some decorative patchwork, it can become a unique item for your social wardrobe, even when it’s long past its business-wear prime.
Step 2: Build a Solid Core
Wringing every bit of usefulness out of your existing wardrobe is good fashion practice and a nice money-saver in the bargain. But it’s unlikely to actually be enough for your needs, and that’s where the core wardrobe comes into play.
Your “core wardrobe” is the foundation on which you build your personal style. It should be sturdy, dependable, and versatile, and the more items you have in it the easier your dressing will be.
Know the “Core” Items
When you think of a core wardrobe, you should be thinking of clothing that you “build off of.” Basically, that means clothing that meets two criterea:
1. Falls within the realm of “normal, everyday” menswear — i.e., collared shirts, suits and jackets, etc.
2. Is simple enough in style to go with outfits, rather than defining them.
A good charcoal gray suit, for example, would be a core item — it’s simple, straightforward, and something you’d expect to see on any number of men. The exact same suit in burgundy red wouldn’t be a core item, because its style is so unusual it defines every outfit it’s a part of.
In general, this is a good list of things that you should consider real “core” items. Your wardrobe doesn’t need to have every single one of them, but they’re all pieces that every man can probably find a use for at some point or another in his life:
· Suits and Jackets
o Dark business suits — gray charcoal, navy blue, etc.
o Navy dress blazers
o Casual sports jackets — tweed, corduroy, etc.
o Unstructured modern jackets — light cotton, fine wool, etc.
· Collared Shirts
o White cotton dress shirts
o Lightly-colored or lightly-patterned dress shirts
o Colored casual shirts
o Denim/flannel work shirts
· Uncollared Shirts
o Sweaters and sweater-vests
o Turtlenecks
o Long-sleeve T-shirts
o T-shirts (dark, solid color or artistic design — no logos, band names, etc.)
· Trousers
o Wool slacks
o Cotton trousers (khakis, etc.)
o Jeans o Corduroys
· Outerwear
o Leather dress shoes
o Canvas sneakers o Loafers, slip-ons, sandals, etc.
o Dress overcoats (wool, thigh-length or longer, etc.)
o Casual overcoats (parkas, field jackets, etc.)
o Leather coats
o Trenchcoats
o Hats and gloves
Sundries like socks, underwear, and undershirts are also “core” items in that every man should own them, but play less of a role in wardrobe planning. Pick those according to your own tastes — most people won’t be seeing them, with the possible exception of your socks.
These are the items you want to own first. The more of them you own, the bigger and more interchangeable your wardrobe is becoming, as nearly all of these can be combined with one another in multiple ways.
Start with Timeless Styles
When you first start building your core you want to keep it simple. Go for pieces that look like they could be worn anywhere. Simple, timeless designs — things that look like your father could have worn it, or his father — aren’t as unique as the latest fashion trend, but you can build a lot more outfits off of them.
Suits, jackets, non-denim trousers, and collared shirts are still the most classic look for a man, though there’s increasing room for jeans and non-collared shirts in the “core” as well. Lean heavily toward those, and look for things that promise extra versatility:
· simple patterns and colors — nothing too aggressive
· traditional materials like worsted wool, flannel, tweed, etc.
· classic cuts and a close, proportional fit
Something that meets all those criteria is something you can probably wear with lots of other classic items. You don’t have to have bought your suit and your shirt from the same brand, or even the same store, for them to look good together, so long as both are in a simple and timeless style.
It’s only when you start buying from very image-specific designers with contemporary styles that it gets hard to match. Stay away from outfits that are designed as complete wholes, from the shoes to the shirt to the collar stays, and buy separate, timeless pieces that you’ll be able to mix and match for years instead.
Invest in Quality
You can do a surprising amount of shopping on the cheap, if you’re willing to wait for sales or hunt for the perfect thrift-store loot. It’s a good way to build a wardrobe over time without breaking the bank. 
That said, it’s worth laying out a little extra money up front for the core pieces that you’re going to wear the most. They’re going to be the bulk of your “look” as other people perceive it — go ahead and get the best clothes you can.
Different men will have different key pieces to invest in. A businessman who wears a suit and tie to work every day will obviously need three or four high-quality suits, whereas a schoolteacher might prefer to spend on a couple of good sports jackets and some tailored shirts and trousers to go under them.
Regardless of the item, your key pieces should be purchased with an eye toward the top markers of quality:
· Fit — tailored if at all possible, and at the very least adjusted to your measurements b a competent tailor.
· Fabric — weight and texture will vary depending on the kind of cloth, but it should drape smoothly and have an even handfeel, with no irregularities or knots in the weave (some fabrics, like tweed, will obviously not be smooth, but they should still be consistent in their roughness).
· Style — a classic, timeless style that works well with your other wardrobe pieces. Those are worth paying good money for — and you should be willing to, on at least a few of your most commonly-worn core pieces.
3. Expand with Style Pieces
If the “core” pieces sound a little boring, don’t be fooled. It’s good to have a core wardrobe that’s a little on the conservative side, but only because you’re going to expand it and make it into your own style with the smaller, accent pieces.
This is where personal taste really comes into play. You build a core wardrobe that covers your “needs” — clothes that work for your professional life and your fundamental role as a well-dressed man. Then you add your “wants” — the clothes that appeal to you personally, and that send the message you want to your viewers.
Define Your Personal Style
Obviously, it helps to have some idea what you want to look like before you start buying clothes.
Take some time to think about influences and things you want to project. Are you looking for a cowboy feel? A thrift store hipster look? A “power” attitude for business deals?
Each of those comes with its own set of accents and styles. Bigger buckles and decorated leather shoes or boots say “cowboy,” while bright, bold neckties and tight-fitted suits are for the power-exec look.
You don’t necessarily even need a stereotype or specific sort of demographic look. Your style wants could be as simple as “I like green things.” Buy yourself some green accents and you’re set.
But this is the part where you get to set your own goals and start buying clothes to achieve them, building your core wardrobe into something much more specific and personalized.
Expand Your Accent Options
One way to personalize is to add variety to what we think of as “accent” pieces. For a lot of men that means a necktie and a wristwatch, and stops there, but there’s no need to limit yourself. Men have a surprising list of potential accents:
· Neckties
o Conventional silk (or synthetic) long neckties
o Knit ties
o Bow ties
· Pocket Squares
o Plain white squares (business formality)
o Colored squares
o Decorative folds (multiple peaks, flowers, etc.)
· Jewelry
o Wristwatches
o Tie accessories (clips, pins, chains, etc.)
o Rings and necklaces (casual settings only, typically)
o Earrings o Cufflinks (for French cuff shirts)
· Leathers
o Dress belts (black and brown leather)
o Decorative belts (cloth, stamped leather, cord, beaded, etc.)
o Belt buckles (large, jeweled, novelty, etc.)
o Decorated dress shoes (buckled loafers, brogues, etc.) 
Outerwear of all sorts can also serve as an accessory or accent piece, especially hats — a fine hat can make an outfit in and of itself, though of course it has to be removed in many circumstances.
These are the ways by which you turn a solid core wardrobe into your own unique look, so go ahead and take advantage of all the options. There’s plenty of variety out there for men who are willing to do a little shopping.
Add Pieces Over Time
Having your core wardrobe in place gives you the luxury of adding “just for fun” pieces over time.
You might be struck by an odd plaid jacket at a rummage sale, or by the latest thing off a top designer’s line. Even if it’s something that’s less versatile, you can go ahead and indulge, as long as you have a good core to back it up. A few pieces will work with it, and you’ll get an outfit or two that you really enjoy wearing.
This final step is essentially lifelong — you can always pick up new pieces and add them to the wardrobe. Keep an eye out for good sales or deals, for items that appeal to your personal tastes, and ideally for the intersection of the two, and strike whenever you see a good buy.
Between your ongoing purchases and your solid core wardrobe, you should never run into trouble keeping your clothing options unique, versatile, and above all interchangeable.

A custom tailored suit is a reflection of his willingness to pay attention to detail, from the color and texture of the fabric to the selection of a cut that flatters his figure. As you will see, we pay attention to these details so that you can focus on the things you consider important.
To learn more about men’s custom tailored suits, visit our style guide.
Below are detailed images of our some of our finished men’s custom suits.
The jacket has notched lapels, straight flapped pockets, four working sleeve buttons and a single vent. You won’t find a deep hued brown such as this in an off the rack men’s suit. A handmade suit such as this can take you from the ordinary to the extraordinary.
This is a regular fitting, three button, single breasted men’s suit crafted from fabric #1-3-16. The jacket has notched lapels, straight flapped pockets, three working sleeve buttons and a single vent.
This medium gray with white beaded stripes is an excellent choice for a 3rd or 4th suit. Not as ordinary as a solid navy blue or charcoal gray suit, it nonetheless is perfectly fine for everyday wear to the office especially for those in finance.
A hallmark of quality workmanship in men’s suits is the ability to match a fabrics patterns in the most visible locations on the suit. A lot of times this requires hours of extra work and more fabric on the part of the tailor shop. We feel it’s worth it; don’t you?
Your jacket lapels should always lay flat against your chest. Here you can see details such as hand stitching in this notched lapel.
Peak lapels on a grey sharkskin jacket (Fabric #1-2-51). Peak lapels are rarely seen on single breasted jackets, yet are a very stylish feature especially for the larger man whose torso takes up a disproportional amount of his body. The wide jacket lapels help bring balance to the presentation, and the vertical lines help elongate a large man’s figure. Peak lapels can also flatter an athletic built man as well.
Two of our men’s suit jackets turned inside out. Here you can see the detail in the lining, the stitching, and the piping (the bit of fabric decorating the border between the suit’s fabric and lining). Also notice the extra buttons (just in case), wide variety of interior pockets, and extra fabric for durability built into the armpits.
On this jacket, you can see that the client asked for a bright red lining. Although a bit flashy, a gentleman can easily keep this secret concealed from the world until he decides to remove his coat in front of others. Then it becomes a conversation starter. That’s the beauty of a custom jacket – it is built to your desires and needs.
Working sleeve cuffs are standard on all of our garments. Their purpose? Historically, it was to protect the cuffs when washing or cleaning. Today, it is a subtle sign that the suit is of quality build. Look around, you’ll see that the vast majority of off the rack suits do not have this feature.
A bespoke jacket with working sleeve buttons is one thing – that they are individually handstitched is a true luxury that many men overlook. Here you can see the “ugly face” of hand stitching on the back off this custom jacket’s button holes (the other side is much cleaner looking). The point – every custom jacket we build is an individual piece of art, hand crafted by a tailor whose attention to detail you can proudly wear.
A man’s trousers are designed to not draw attention to themselves; instead, they draw the eyes upward towards the jacket or downward towards the shoes. But just because trousers play a supporting role does not mean we overlooked any details in your pant’s construction.
Here you can see another special request, button-fly trousers. Common in jeans, this is much harder to pull off in close fitting dress trousers as that there is no room for an unsightly bulge. All buttons are hand sewn as well!
Here is a different view of a pair of men’s trousers, exposing the three fastening in an extended waist strap. The purpose of three fastenings? To evenly distribute the pressure placed on your fastenings as you move throughout the day. The result is a pair of men’s trousers that not only fit better but feel better.
Here we can see the interior, specifically the trouser backside. Notice the amount of fabric built into the trousers; this allows adjustment in the case you have a little too much to eat over the holidays.
Another view of the interior of a pair of men’s trousers. Here the customer asked for an elastic rubber shirt stay strap around the waist (free upon request, although not recommended). Here we can see the inner lining that goes up the front of the thighs to ensure the fabric drapes properly; additionally we place extra fabric around the crotch area for comfort and durability.
A favorite for travelers, the hidden money/credit card/identification pocket on our custom trousers is something you’ll never find on off the rack trousers. Walking through a crowded bazaar, you’ll have no need to worry about pickpockets making off with your cash or ID.
Tired of wearing belts? Why not try an elastic band that fits around the back and can tighten your trousers when you need it. A detail such as this is almost impossible to find at any department store – but for our customers side tabs are only a request away.
The interior of our pant’s cuffs – notice the extra fabric sewn at the end? A small detail, but one that will help protect your investment from the wear and tear of everyday use.
Our customers come from all walks of life and work in a variety of professions; however they all share the confidence of knowing they look great in the clothing we have helped them create. Do you feel this way in your suit?"

Are you tired of your sleeves being too short, of too much fabric around the waist, of no choice when it comes to color?
Enter the world of custom made dress shirts. The strength of a bespoke shirt is that it is created from scratch using your measurements and wishes as the guide. The neck, the sleeves, the chest, and the stomach are all designed to your specifications to ensure it fits you perfectly. Equally important, you can design the shirt to complement your body type and complexion. Choose the collar that properly frames your face, the cuffs that signal attention to detail, the color that accentuates your skin tone.

Below are pictures of some of our finished men’s bespoke dress shirts .
A light blue solid broadcloth – an American classic, this men’s bespoke dress shirt features our standard business collar, a plain front with no breast pocket, and a perfect fit. Cut from fabric 4-6-83, this dress shirt lets a perfect cut do all the talking.
A bit less formal, the below custom-made men’s dress shirt is cut from fabric 4-4-1. It is perfect for daily office wear or meeting friends downtown after work. Match it with a solid men’s bespoke suit and you have an unbeatable combination.
Checks are traditionally the least formal pattern, but the classic style of this shirt cut from fabric 4-6-1 enables it to be worn almost anywhere.
These thicker checks are perfect for men looking to create an illusion of added weight and heft – perfect for the tall and thin (although not so for those a bit larger in the torso). This bespoke men’s shirt is cut from fabric 4-6-33.
Pictures do not do this beautiful white with pink stripe shirt justice – this is a beautiful fabric (4-6-8) with a great weave. A very subtle pattern, this shirt can be worn in place of a white shirt with a solid navy blue or charcoal custom men’s suit.
A black herringbone 100% cotton men’s dress shirt – very rare in off the rack clothing, this fabric (4-6-71) is just one of the over 200 fabrics we feature online (we have access to literally thousands of men’s shirt fabrics – if you don’t find what you are looking for, just ask).
Here we see fabric #4-4-7 crafted into a men’s custom dress shirt with a regular business collar, left breast pocket, and a panel front. The regular business collar is an excellent choice for those who have the option of wearing a tie. This shirt collar style looks great either way.
This is fabric #4-3-34 with a medium spread collar. The thing to note here are the removable collar stays, a hallmark of a fine custom-made shirt. If used properly you’ll never have to deal with folding collars again. This is standard on all of our men’s dress shirts, complete with simple plastic stays. If you would like to purchase high quality metal stays, go to our resource page and check out a company called Workin Stiffs. Their magnetic stays are really innovative.
Another detail to look for when inspecting quality men’s shirts is the yoke. Split yokes are standard on our dress shirts, as that we believe they provide a better fit. A key detail here is to make sure the patterns match up on the dress shirt’s split yoke. As you can see below, our men’s shirts do not overlook this detail.
While on the subject of pattern matching, another location to ensure a dress shirt measures up are the shoulders. Stitching quality and pattern matching are small but important details in determining a shirt’s pedigree. We let our work speak for itself.
Here is another view of pattern matching on one of our men’s custom dress shirts. Are the shirts in your closet crafted with this amount of care?
We build our men’s dress shirts to last. Little details such as the placement of extra fabric at the bottom of the shirts side ensure your garments stand up to the wear and tear of multiple wearings and washings.
Perhaps the quickest way to determine the quality of a shirt is it’s buttons. Mother of pearl buttons are the gold standard. Rarely seen on ready made shirts, they have the unique qualities of superior hardness and a less thick build than their plastic counter-parts.
In this image of a monogram on a men’s dress shirt cuff notice how the lettering follows the fabrics pattern. No detail is too small here at A Tailored Suit.
This is custom dress shirt crafted with fabric #4-3-31. You won’t find patterns or cuts like this in a department store."

Clothing no gentlemen should be without, the sports jacket and blazer are perfect ways to complete a casual outfit. Our sports jackets and blazers vary based off of your choices in design and your needs as an individual.

Below are pictures of one of our finished men’s bespoke sports jackets.
Here we see a bespoke gray men’s sports jacket with subtle blue stripes. Notice the hand stitching along the notch lapels and the fully functional boutonniere hole. Instead of wearing a tie, this client has opted to infuse some color around his neck with a contrasting inner collar.
Here we see at tan sharkskin custom two button sports jacket with two buttons on the sleeve to highlight the casual nature of the jacket. But as if to bring us back to its regal origins, the client opted for roped shoulders that cut a striking silhouette.
This gentlemen chose to have only two working buttons, as that he wanted to keep it consistent with his front button choice. All of our button are fully functional (a hallmark of handmade suits).
Another example of working sleeve buttons on a custom bespoke jacket.
Most people will never see the inner lining of your sports jacket or blazer; that’s a shame, because the interior of our jackets are just as beautiful as their exteriors. Here is an example of a very bright lining that the client wanted to show off when he removes his jacket – a young consultant, he wanted to signal that this wasn’t an off the rack buy. For most men though, we suggest letting us match the lining with the jacket.
Called piping, this gold lining helps bridge the gap between the bespoke jacket’s lining and it’s fabric.
A small but important detail. Your jackets front buttons can be called upon to withstand a bit of stress. Every sports jacket we make has these tiny back buttons sewn behind their larger counterparts to help distribute the pressure. What does this mean for you? A longer lasting Sports Jacket and Blazer.
You rarely see ticket pockets on ready-made men’s suits. This detail is often found right above the right side pocket on a jacket, and sends the signal that this garment is not your run of the mill clothing. Ticket pockets looks especially regal on tall men. Below you can see the English variant, the angled hacking pocket. Angled pockets trace their origin back to the English riding jackets.
A functioning ticket pocket – what do you use it for? Well, to hold tickets of course!
All of our pockets are convertible. That is, they can be worn as either flapped or tucked in. The tucked in look is for the occasions you are looking to raise the level of formality of the coat or just want to try something new. If you are going for a casual look, consider flap pockets (not shown)."

The answer is the overcoat, a garment whose dual purpose is functionality, protecting you from the elements, and style, maintaining the professional look you seek to project. Fit is especially important for an overcoat; if it is too large (as most men tend to wear them), it will not effectively protect its owner from the cold. A properly cut custom overcoat can not only highlight a man’s physical strengths (athletic cut, broad shoulders), it can also be adjusted to be incredibly versatile (extra interior lining for warmth, working upper buttons and collar to protect the neck, etc.) To learn more about men’s custom tailored overcoats, visit our style guide.
Below are pictures of one of our finished bespoke overcoats.
This view of the men’s overcoat allows us to see better the covered front buttons and the bare right breast pocket. Breast pockets are optional, but one is recommended so that you have the opportunity to add some color to your ensemble on a dreary winter day.
In this photo we can see the overcoat’s fit. With hands down, the overcoat’s sleeves will extend far enough to cover the shirt sleeves but bend the arms up and the clothing underneath is slightly exposed. Also we can see here the sleeve buttons; as on all of our garments, the sleeve buttons are fully functional.
Functionality is very important in a men’s overcoat; this garment not only needs to look good, but it has to protect you from the elements. Here we can see that the top buttons are fully functional and the collar easily folds up to protect the neck. Also, the hand pockets were placed perfectly so that the wearers hands could slide right in. Not visible, but available upon request are extras such as a heavier interior lining for those living in especially cold climates."

https://atailoredsuit.com/how-to-select-necktie.html,"Select a tie to go with your suit

There are so many options and finding the perfect one can be overwhelming.
This article is going to show you how to select a necktie in three easy steps.
Why is a necktie important?
A tie is important because it will often add the dash of flavor and strong accent to the overall outfit with its color and pattern.
While suits are typically gray, navy, or black and dress shirts either blue or white, neckties come in all sorts of colors, patterns, and sizes.
Choosing a necktie can be easy
All you need is to understand a little bit about:
Necktie patterns range from stripes to paisleys to tartan-check.
The #1 rule for matching patterns is that no two pieces of clothing should use the same pattern size or type.
What is pattern size?
Pattern size is the distance between the stripes on your shirt and the width of the stripes on your tie.  The pattern sizes on your shirt and your necktie should not be the same.  By doing this you can create an optical illusion of movement which the human eye finds unattractive.
Here is an example of a good match
A subtle pinstriped suit with a larger check patterned dress shirt and intricate paisley pattern tie is acceptable;
Example of a bad or questionable match
Wearing that same pin-striped suit and large check patterned dress shirt with a striped tie that that is similar to the suit’s stripe separation will create a questionable look.
Of all three factors, pattern is the most important.  A man will not wear a color he doesn’t like but will often choose the wrong pattern.
For the purposes of tie matching we do not classify solid colored ties as having any pattern.
Therefore the rules of pattern matching do not apply to true solid colored neckwear.
As a result you could match multiple solids. A combination of solids might appear boring, but acceptable and safe.  However,  because pattern is not a factor the next two variables are even more important when considering a solid necktie.
When matching color the first thing you want do is make sure that the colors of your clothing are in harmony.
Trust your gut instinct. 
If you have doubts trust your gut and try something different.
You could try and “convince yourself” something matches, but then you won’t wear it with confidence.  Trust first impressions – others you meet will.
What does it mean to match? 
 What has precedent in terms of priority?
If you feel your tie does not match, do not try to force it. 
If you are not sure, the safest bet is to stick with the traditional red business necktie.
Non-bright red and to a lesser extent gold and blue will go with most dark suits and  white or light to medium-blue shirt combinations.
Finally, always remember that you want the necktie to accent your suit and shirt, not dominate them.  If your tie overpowers your suit, you can bet it will draw attention from your face as well.
Although often not as important as  pattern or color, proportion plays a role in matching your necktie.
What is proportion?Proportion is the size of the tie and how wide it is.
Which proportion is for me?
It depends on your height, weight, and the width of your suit’s lapels.
A thin petite man will look sharp with thin lapels and a thin tie.
However, a large man with wider build lapels wearing the same skinny tie will look ridiculous.
Now you know how to use pattern, color, and proportion to select the best tie for your outfit. 
Are you ready for another challenge?
I would like to offer you my challenge – it is a simple course designed to transform your style by making small steps each day for the next 30 days.

https://atailoredsuit.com/seiko-watch-buying-guide.html,"How to buy a Seiko watch?
If you’re wondering this question it’s likely you’ve gone through a similar process to many other men:
There’s more than one budget watch company out there so why choose Seiko?
Simply put, Seiko is the most widely-known Japanese watch company next to Casio.
Seiko watches are affordable but that doesn’t mean low-quality. Seiko’s are by and large reliable and come with a quality feel for the price you pay.
Affordable prices also do not have to mean bad design. Many affordable watches are ‘homages’ (also known as rip-offs) of luxury watches like the Rolex Submariner. Seiko takes their own designs that have real history behind them and iterates to keep them modern.
Rolex makes great watches, but they have a reputation. To some, they mean success, ambition and confidence. To others? Arrogance, greed and peacocking. By contrast, to 99% of people a Seiko will just look like a good watch on your wrist.
Seiko produces a wide variety of watch styles, they run the gamut from casual field watches to dive watches to formal dress watches and everything in between. Whatever watch you are looking for, Seiko will sell one you should consider. In fact, you could build an entire collection from Seiko if you wanted to.
In this article I’m going to cover:
For the professional watch enthusiasts among you, there will be a topic conspicuous by its absence and that’s Seiko’s high-end offerings sold under the King Seiko and Grand Seiko brands. Seiko offers a huge variety of watches so to make sure I do the company justice, in this article I’m going to be focusing on the main brand and it’s most popular offerings. But watch this space!
Without further ado, how did a one-man watch and jewelry shop in 19th-century Tokyo turn into an international watchmaking superpower that today dominates the low and mid-end market?
Japanese clockmaker apprentice Kintaro Hattori founds ‘K. Hattori’ a watch and jewelry shop – succeeds by offering hard-to-find watches through building close relationships with Swiss manufacturers
Kintaro manufactures his own clocks through a new company: Seikosha (meaning house of exquisite workmanship)
Renamed Seiko, releases first wristwatch
The first Grand Seiko is launched (production halted 1975, resumed 1991)
One of the first companies to release an automatic chronograph (Seiko 5 Sports Speed Timer) AND also the first company to mass-market quartz watches (the Astron) https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-16/a-concise-history-of-the-quartz-watch-revolution
When iconic Vietnam war movie Apocalypse Now is released, with Martin Sheen as Captain Willard, and a Seiko Prospex Diver 6105-8110 on his wrist, it is confirmed to civilians what US servicemen already knew. Seikos are affordable and can take a beating. In truth, this watch was one of many servicemen wore, competing against Seiko’s own DX 6106 as well as the Glycine Airman, the Rolex GMT Master and many more for time on the wrist of US military personnel.
?
?
?

Seiko partners with Italian supercar designer Giorgetto Giugiaro. This partnership culminates three years later when the Seiko Giugiaro is seen on Sigourney Weaver’s wrist as Ripley in Alien – cementing Seiko in western pop culture by proving they could do more than just dress watches and dive watches.
?
Thinking outside the box didn’t end in the 80s. Everyone today recognizes the Amazon Kindle, famous for its e-ink technology which gives it top-drawer battery length and visibility in direct sunlight. The Seiko E Ink was the world’s first e-ink watch, good legibility being an important benefit for watches – demonstrating Seiko’s interest in any technology which would help its customers, no matter how non-tradition it might be.
?
We’re in the 2010s now, almost there. Seiko releases the Fugaku 6830 from sub-brand Credor. An understated name befitting a very small watch. This was the world’s smallest tourbillon by volume and Seiko’s first tourbillon.
?
There you have it, a Japanese brand with a deep attachment to America and not afraid to utilize modern techniques while still respecting watchmaking tradition.
How is Seiko doing today?
They continue to maintain a wide range of watches and some might argue that expanding ever-deeper into the US market is taking its toll.
In recent years, quality control has been mentioned online with some users finding Seiko’s US service center carries out repairs slowly or ships the wrong parts to local stores.
It is unusual but not unheard-of for Seiko watches to run slow and some Seiko diving watches have misaligned bezels.
That said, people love Seiko for a reason and I wouldn’t let a few errors get in the way of trying the brand out. Just be careful, make sure you get the manufacturer’s warranty for example.
To help you make an informed purchase decision, I have put together the essential words and phrases you need to understand the anatomy of a watch. Particularly when researching or buying online, this is critical to understand how each watch is put together.
Case – The body of the watch housing internal moving parts
Crown – Twistable knob on the side – sets the time, allows manual winding
Watch crystal – Protective, transparent top to a watch – The quality of the crystal determines its strength and level of protection
Bezel  – The metal ring around the outside of the watch face holding down the crystal – Some bezels such as those found on dive watches will rotate
Lugs – Metal projections from the case which secure the leather/rubber strap or metal bracelet
Movement/Calibre – The mechanical clockwork which operates the hands and complications
Bracelet/Strap – The material (usually metal, leather or rubber) that holds the watch case tight on your wrist
Clasp – Where the watch bracelet widens or opens to let you fasten the watch on your wrist
What are the materials you will normally find in a Seiko watch?
I mentioned bezels earlier and it’s worth exploring further because there are several variations that can be found on Seikos.
What kind of bracelets and straps will you normally find on a Seiko?
[pic 8]
?
The clasp is what keeps your metal bracelet or leather strap attached to your wrist so it’s extremely important.
Want to know what makes a Seiko tick? This is precisely what a watch’s movement does.
There are several key characteristics you can expect from a mid-range Seiko watch:
First, the vast majority of Seiko watches will have an ‘automatic’ movement which means it winds itself using the movement of your wrist. No manual winding should be required but you can give it a jumpstart if the watch has stopped after being unworn for several days. How long will the average Seiko run for without any winding? Approximately 40 hours.
Next, the average Seiko will have a ‘hacking seconds’ feature which means when you pull out the crown, the seconds hand stops, allowing you to more easily set a precise time. Historically, this was a feature favored by pilots, divers, the military and any environment where every second counts.
What features should you expect from a Seiko movement? Most Seikos are relatively straightforward with just hours, minutes and seconds hands plus a date function. For most men, this gives you everything you need and nothing you don’t.
What about the ‘sweep’ of the watch’s second hand? Most Seiko movements beat at 21,600 beats per hour (bph) which results in less than ten changes of the seconds hand per second. This results in a slight judder that is less smooth than the 28,000 bph found on premium and luxury watches such as Rolexes.
Here are three of the most common movements found in Seikos:
The movement is the beating heart of a watch so make sure to do your research and find out which movement a watch you are buying has at its core. Seiko updates their movements on a semi-frequent basis so it is worth checking, particularly if you are considering buying second-hand.
It’s important to find the Seiko that’s perfect for you. But when there’s so much variety to choose from, it’s completely understandable you want somewhere to start.
Without further ado, here are some of the best Seikos I’ve owned and some I wish I owned!
?
This is a quality dive watch and one of my all-time Seiko favorites. Its 200m of water resistance matches some luxury watches such as the Black Bay Fifty-Eight manufactured by Tudor: Rolex’s sister company.
?
Seiko 5’s come in an incredible number of varieties but I absolutely love this one. Why? This is highly affordable dress watch option.
This watch can sometimes can be found for less than $100 but is mechanical, comes with a practical day-date complication and a sunray dial and exhibition caseback for extra class. You really can’t ask for much more at this price point.
?
A more adventurous Seiko 5! You have the same day-date complication but a chunky unidirection stainless steel bezel and thicker, heavily lumed hands for extra help telling the time in the dark.
?
See what I mean about the Seiko 5 being versatile? This is a smart-casual option with a 120-click unidirectional bottlecap-shaped bezel (hence the name). The uncoated stainless steel of the bezel gives this a slightly classier look while being slightly reminiscent of the Rolex Explorer II. The crown being placed at 4 o’clock instead of 3 o’clock is a trademark Seiko feature which is a nod to Captain Willard’s Prospex Diver.
?
I couldn’t include the sporty dive-inspired Seiko 5’s above without including the OG Seiko 5. This is a classic field watch style and one of the most popular Seiko models – ever.
Why? It’s a versatile, smart-casual look which you can have a bit more fun with this model. The fabric strap doesn’t feel cheap and comes in a variety of colors, matching the look of each watch.
?
If you have a slightly larger budget and you’re a fan of Man Men and midcentury design then this is the perfect dress watch for you.
Why? The sunray dial has been taken up a notch and combined with the three-dimension, beveled hour and minute markers this just oozes class. Designed in collaboration with an award-winning Tokyo mixologist named Ishigaki Shinobu, it won’t surprise you to learn this watch looks good during the day but looks even better in cocktail bars and upscale nighttime events.
This watch is definitely on my wish list!
?
First made in 1959 for Japanese Yama-otoko, mountain men, the Alpinist is one of Seiko’s most popular watches online and for good reason. It’s inner bezel, a somewhat unusual feature in and of itself, provides genuine practicality for hikers in the form of a rotating compass ring. The traditional forest-green dial and mountain-shaped hour markers reinforces the image Seiko is going for here.
Sapphire crystal and 200m water resistance add to the practicality, making this watch as tough as any other. This watch’s specs have also been bumped up for 2021 with anti-reflect (AR) coating on the inside of the crystal, a ‘cyclops’ date magnifier for easier reading. Plus, a 70 hour power reserve means you can leave this watch on your dresser Friday evening and it will still be ticking when you pick it up Monday morning.
I have the previous iteration of this watch and although the color never worked for me, I see why this model has a fan following all of its own. The 2021 edition is definitely a great upgrade I think people are going to love.
?
One of Seiko’s premium divers combining old and new design. Again, we have the old-school crown placement at four o’clock but a modern pointer arrow-shaped hour hand to make the watch super-legible.
The brushed stainless steel design will hide scratches but also makes this worthy of your wrist at work. I’ve gotta get myself one of these!
How do you know the time is right to buy a Seiko? Or any watch for that matter?
You can buy a watch at any time as long as you have the funds. That said, keep this in mind:
A watch rests directly against the skin and is highly visible on the wrist, making it a deeply personal part of a man’s wardrobe. For this reason, a good time to buy a watch is a life event such as graduating college, milestone birthdays, getting married or a promotion at work.
Whatever the reason for you buying a Seiko, make sure you are buying it for yourself and not to impress a co-worker or fellow watch enthusiast. Find your perfect watch, not someone else’s.
There are many ways to buy from Seiko. You can purchase via Amazon, authorized dealers, department stores. Plus, you can always go second-hand of course.
Unless you’re an experienced watch collector, my recommendation is to buy from a certified Seiko dealer. This can be either a specialist watch store or a department store but the reason is you want to make sure you get the manufacturer warranty so you are fully protected in the event you get a watch with a misaligned bezel, malfunctioning movement or another defect. Other businesses might offer their own warranty and sometimes they will honor your purchase and resolve the issue but know that there’s an element of risk involved if you go down this route.
What does Seiko themselves have to say on the matter?
Seiko believes that the best way for you to select and purchase a Seiko watch is at one of our authorized retail stores. Only in these stores can you be sure to find the latest Seiko collection, and be sure that your new watch bracelet is sized and fitted correctly, free of charge.
How to make sure you’re using an authorized dealer? Use the Seiko store finder to locate your nearest authorized dealer anywhere in the world."
https://atailoredsuit.com/man-navy-blue-blazer.html,"Want to keep your style simple and still look great? 
You should own a navy blazer.
The beauty of the navy blue blazer jacket is that it goes with almost anything.
Why Should a Man Own a Navy Blue Blazer?
The possibilities of what to wear with a navy blue blazer are endless.
The classic single-breasted navy wool coat with brass, horn, or plastic buttons is perhaps the best investment a man can make in his wardrobe.
It doubles the available outfits a man has to choose from each morning when he gets dressed. It will serve you nobly in a wide range of situations, and it will not go out of style in your lifetime.
Blazers Can Be Formal Or Casual
A blazer can be a  classic almost formal outfit. Put it on with  gray flannel slacks, a white button-down oxford shirt and a striped tie, and you are  just shy of a suit on the formality scale.
The navy blue blazer gives you a simple solution to the tricky problem of dressing respectably without appearing aloof in a business casual environment.
In a workplace dominated by polo shirts and khakis, the man who has the instinct and the class to wear a blazer over the ensemble looks distinctive without standing out.
Blazers Can Be Casual  
Imagine it’s the weekend. The  same blazer over chinos and a polo shirt makes a very smart casual outfit. A man can build many handsome outfits  around his navy blue blazer. Let’s go over a few of them.
What a Man wears with a Navy Blazer
What Goes With A Navy Blazer?
A men’s blazer looks aristocratic and dignified over an ecru turtleneck and your trusty gray flannels.
For a laid-back look in the summer wear it with off-white pants and a bright polo.
A men’s dress shirt with a button-down collar and gray flannels go great with a navy blazer. Adding  a tie stake it up a notch. If you want to formalize it, a point collar shirt will get the job done.
But stop right there.
Contrast collars really belong under a suit, and even if the formality of French cuffs were not an issue, having cuff-links next to brass sleeve buttons creates a clash of shininess.
Where To Wear A Blazer 
The blazer outfits described above are smart choices for dinner in a nice restaurant or a morning religious service.
In fact, the blazer will serve you well for most weekend activities – from taking in a play to cheering on a girls’ softball team.
While it is perfectly acceptable to wear a navy blue blazer with jeans, make sure the pants and coat are not too close in color. This goes for any jacket and pants combination.  It it’s not a suit, it shouldn’t look like one from a distance.
Matching Shoes with a Navy Blazer 
For footwear, bluchers, loafers, and monkstraps are all fantastic options.
Brown suede dress shoes match the navy blue blazer very well.
Black shoes, other than oxfords and wingtips, are also fine complements.
Anytime you wear a blazer you should wear some sort of patterned socks. They can be  checked, striped, or argyle.
When you forgo a tie, your socks provide a great opportunity to inject a little pizzazz into your look, especially if you wear a solid shirt.
Matching Trousers to a Men’s Blazer
Bringing our focus to trousers, gray flannels are always the best ..choice to wear with a blazer.
But if you plan on doing  a lot of walking or running you may be more comfortable in cotton chinos
Depending on your personal style  you can wear chinos with or without pleats. Both look great with a blue blazer.
Besides the traditional khaki,  stone, hunter green, and wine red will look fantastic with the blazer.
On cold days, you will appreciate the added warmth of cavalry twills, while in the summer heat linen pants are a cool and comfortable choice to wear with a blazer.

Dress Shirts and the Navy Blazer 
Besides solids, a broad variety of stripes and checks mix well with a blazer. Dark, solid fabric looks great  next to just about anything, and the shiny buttons comfortably counter the bold  patterns.
For a more casual look, go with a long-sleeve polo shirt or a turtleneck, depending on the climate.
Navy Blazer and Men’s Sweaters
In cooler weather, you will want to wear a sweater under your blazer jacket.
The best sweaters are made from wool or cashmere.
They do an excellent job of retaining your body heat and do not add considerable bulk.
If you’re wearing a blazer without a tie, a cable-knit or argyle crew-neck will add some life to the outfit.
The V-neck worn over a tie may also be patterned or textured, but can be solid as well.
Sweater vests, buttoned or without buttons, also an option with a navy blazer.
Have Fun But Don’t Overdo It
Sweaters that scream with loud colors and patterns are too memorable and limited in a wardrobe rotation.
Blues, greens, browns, and other natural tones complement almost any man, match well with a wide range of clothing,   and are easy to find.
Matching Neckties, Pocket Squares, and Belts with a Navy Blazer
Finally, a few words on neckwear and accessories that should be worn with a navy blazer. Look to keep the tie you wear with a navy blazer sporty.
Good choices are oven silks in polka dots, bold stripes, and other simple patterns.
What About Bow Ties?
The bow tie with white shirt and blue blazer looks sophisticated on the few men who know precisely how and when to wear it but goofy on most everyone else.
Beyond ties, a pocket square that harmonizes with the rest of the outfit adds a dash of style to a blazer. For younger men, it will also make sure that a blazer and white shirt don’t look like they are wearing a prep school uniform.
What About Belts and Navy Blazer? 
For belts, follow the old rule: match leather to leather, metal to metal.
That means brown with brown shoes  and black with black.
The buckle should be brass to coordinate with the blazer’s buttons."
https://atailoredsuit.com/importance-proper-fit-menswear.html,"“I can’t wait to get out of this suit and tie!”
How many times have you heard men say this?
Or what about this line?
“I can’t wait to take off this suit and slip on comfortable jeans and a t-shirt.”
Contrary to popular belief, men’s dress clothes should always be comfortable.
There is a popular myth that business attire and dress clothes by nature are not comfortable.
If they are not, it’s not the nature of the clothes it’s the bad fit.
Suffering for beauty’s sake does not do a man any good. If the fit of a garment makes a man uncomfortable he will look it.
Indeed, a man looks his best when his clothes fit so well he barely notices them.
On the other hand, if his suit or dress shirt are too tight, they will be pulling and choking at every turn. If it is too loose,  a man looks like he  had to borrow some clean clothes from his bigger older brother. He will be fighting the extra fabric all day long.
A man’s clothes send a message to the world about him.
If they fit him well he will always make a good impression.
Most men today wear poorly-fitting clothes, and it is not hard to see why. The menswear sold in stores are cut to fit as many men as possible, and that means big.
At the same time, the fashion-industrial complex creates new so-called styles by bending or breaking the time-honored traditions in menswear.
Designers and commentators debate whether baggy or fitted pants are ‘in’ this season while neither look as good as the timeless middle-ground.
A good deal of men still rely on women to hold their hands through shopping trips.  But since the prerogatives of fit are altogether different for women’s clothing, the results are often sorry.
Finally, when you are buying a garment, the retailer haslittle incentive to tailor it properly,since nobody seeks out a mall store because he’s heard they do great alterations.
It falls to each man to take responsibility for the fit of his own clothes. He must not to be swayed by the  selection of poor choices or the dubious influence of models, a salesman, and the opposite sex.
The first step in acquiring properly fitting clothes is knowing what proper fit looks like.
In general, clothes should be comfortable, but not loose. Pants should be worn at the natural waist, near the navel. Young people with flat stomachs may choose to wear them lower, as has been the style for a decade or so, but they gain little in doing so.
The man with a belly, on the other hand, looks much better with high-rise trousers draping from his middle than with his stomach spilling over a low-rise waistband.
The trouser cuff’s bottoms should touch your shoes’ uppers but  must not touch the ground. The most standard length brushes the top edge of the sole at the back, for a slight break in the front.
Shorter pant legs, just brushing the tops of the shoes, can look better on the shorter man, and also him  to show off his socks and shoes.
Additionally, men under 5’9″ do better without cuffs on their trousers, but should they want them they should be in proportion to their stature, 1¼”-1½”, while men over six feet take cuffs 1¾”-2″.
If a jacket has any hope of looking good it must fit correctly in the chest and shoulders.
When you stand with your jacket buttoned and arms hanging loosely at your sides, the jacket’s lapels should lie flat against the front panels, the buttons should hang close to or rest lightly on your stomach, and your biceps should just barely break the drape of sleeve from shoulder.
Of the many other factors involved in fitting a jacket, the chest and shoulders are the most important and the hardest to alter.
Your shirt should always be tighter than your jacket, or you will you end up with clumps of fabric that  have no place to go.
The cuffs should protrude ¼”-½” from the jacket’s sleeves when you stand with arms hanging; the collar should cover ½”-1″ of your neck above the jacket collar.
There is of course much more to say about the fit of these and other garments. These points are intended merely to illustrate the basic idea of fit.
Buying clothes that fit means buying clothes that fit your body, as it is, and not measuring them to an idealized vision you have of yourself.
Many men, when getting measured for a suit, will stick out their chests and stretch their spines, striving toward some idealized masculine figure. Unless this is how you stand normally this is not how you should be measured. You can round your height up an inch on your driver’s license but you only hurt yourself by embellishing for your tailor.
Similarly, in certain cultures where weight loss is an obsession, some men succumb to the folly of ‘buying skinny.’ That is, they buy clothes one size too small, anticipating a perfect fit when they lose weight. This is a dangerous proposition for your bank account and your self esteem.
Almost any shirt, sweater, or jacket that fits you well will still fit well if you gain or lose ten pounds.
Men’s trousers are the most sensitive, but even these will withstand small fluctuations in weight.
When your waistline does shrink or grow by a half inch or more, they can easily be altered, often several inches in either direction.
Unless you are still going through puberty, you have nothing to gain by selecting clothes which do not fit your body as it is today.
It is a magnificent feeling to put on clothes that have been tailored to fit you perfectly.
You feel light and comfortable. Your clothes seem to float around your body. They are not tight or heavy  anywhere. Clearly, getting such clothes retail is nearly impossible, or more men would do it.
While there may be a suit that fits you perfectly somewhere, your odds of finding it are slim.
Even to build a small wardrobe of decently fitting garments, a man must spend many hours searching through racks and trying things on.
Fortunately, though, custom made tailored clothing is as affordable as designer brands.  Once you know your  dimensions  and have a trusted source, it is simple to get custom fitted clothes that you feel and look great in.

https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-pocket-square-types.html,"Do you wear a suit and tie?
Want to set yourself apart from the crowd in a good way?
A pocket square will do that.
In the early 1900s, a suit without a pocket square was considered almost naked.
Today it is still a key accessory for a true gentleman. Wearing a pocket square adds a hint of personality to a suit.
Although it’s a simple accessory, it effortlessly adds character to suit jackets and blazers.
Nowadays, the pocket square is becoming a sartorial signature for a new generation of men.
And it says a lot about your personality.
Pocket squares come in a variety of colors and patterns.
A pocket square is appropriate for most outfits. It should should be chosen to contrast with the shirt and tie while still being set off against the color of the jacket.
Coordinated Contrast
A coordinated contrast is a combination of pattern and fabric that is different than the suit, shirt, and tie, but not so unlike as to clash.
Solid White Handkerchiefs – Linen and Cotton
The classic dress handkerchief is the solid white square, made of linen or cotton.
Depending on the chosen fold, it may be lightly starched to provide body.
The white square is acceptable for almost any ensemble but looks particularly good with dark, conservative suits where its crisp clean appearance makes it stand out in a positive way.
Silk Handkerchiefs
Silk squares are what a gentleman is most likely to encounter in department store. There are usually dozens on display.
These handkerchiefs come in nearly every color and pattern imaginable, and offer far more opportunity to make a bold and distinctive statement.
Because there are so many colors and patterns to choose from, these are the handkerchiefs that produce much of the stress associated with wearing a square.
Quality:
A hand-rolled edge is a sign of quality and attention to detail and should be present on a well-made square.
How to Match a square to your jacket and tie
When selecting the type of fabric for a dress handkerchief, the fabric of the jacket and tie should be considered. Mix silk squares with heavier tie fabrics, and more textured handkerchiefs with smooth ties. This is an excellent way to add contrast, while silk squares against a rough jacket like tweed is particularly distinctive.
Wool suits, the most common option, are equally at home with linen or silk, as are silk ties – indeed, the variety of patterns available in silk may require a silk square for some ensembles.
How to choose patterns
Look to the most brightly colored or patterned item in the outfit. In most cases, this will be the necktie.
With solid ensembles, patterns are particularly distinctive, and while solid squares may seem a safer choice for patterned ties, a contrasting patterned square provides a very elegant look.
Handkerchief Color 
As for color, it’s best to determine the base color for whatever item is being matched then opt for a complimenting color. It is best not to match the square directly to a prominent color. Instead, match it to a secondary color as an accent.
As with everything else in classic style, the choice of color should take into account the occasion you are wearing if for.
For example, though it is only a few inches of visible material, a boldly colored square would probably be  out of place at a funeral or wedding."
https://atailoredsuit.com/what-is-dress-shirt.html,"Well, to start with it has a collar, buttons, and long sleeves.
Sounds pretty simple, right?
Depending on how formal you want to get, dress shirts have different sorts of collars and cuffs that range from casual to super formal.
Fifty years ago the dress shirt was more of an undergarment. It usually only came in white and was hardly ever seen without a jacket or a coat.  As time passed and style trends changed, the dress shirt became more than just an undergarment. It became a stand-alone fashion piece.That is  why it is today available in so many colors, patterns.
Back in the olden days very few men had what we call “white collar jobs”. Most men had jobs that involved manual labor and getting their hands dirty. Having clean white cuffs on a shirt was a status symbol that meant you were above dirty manual labor. It meant you had a job with status.
Dress Shirts Offer Variety
Today,
whether you wear tan slacks with boat shoes or are a suit and tie man, long sleeve shirts are an essential and large part of a wardrobe.
They offer variety and are less expensive than mixing and matching entire suits and expensive leather shoes.
Whatever it is worn with, a shirt should fit comfortably snug without restricting movement.
At the end of the day, the main purpose of the dress shirt is to protect the inside of a men’s suit jacket from absorbing too much sweat and grease from the body. 
 Likewise,  men’s white undershirt can be used to keep a dress shirt looking crisper and cleaner for longer by acting as this barrier between the skin and the fabric. 
Color and Patter of a Dress Shirt
The first thing you notice about a dress shirt is its color and pattern, closely followed by its fabric type.
Most men’s shirts are solid white or blue. If you want to get the most out of looking great with a variety of colors, you need to understand how your personal complexion relates to patterns and colors. 
Matching the right shirt with a classical suit can turn an ordinary outfit into an extraordinary one. 
As to fabric type, this depends mostly on your personal preference, 
needs, and how much money you have.
If you have a large budget, pure sea island cotton represents the higher end and more expensive fibers.
Pima cotton and man-made fiber blend will appeal to the individual on a more modest budget.

The key elements  to a dress shirt’s style 
the shirt’s back, 
What does a certain collar type symbolize?
A button down collar, left breast pocket, and single-button cuffs signal leisure while a shirt with turned-down point collar, no breast pocket, and french cuffs signals formality.
The beauty of a custom shirt is that you can design the shirt’s style not only for the occasion but also to complement your physical features.
More on shirt styles is covered in A Deeper Understanding of the Dress Shirt.
Here is some advice:
If you are building your dress shirt collection, make it versatile with your other clothing. 
To save money and make it simple, buy shirts that you can wear with any suit you own.
Avoid extremes and start slow and easy with safe colors and patterns. As you gain more confidence and style knowledge, you can experiment with a bolder variety of patterns and colors."
https://atailoredsuit.com/10-tips-to-look-great-while-carrying-a-concealed-firearm.html,"Thinking about wearing a concealed carry firearm?
Still want to look great?
There are a few factors to consider.
While open carry is pretty straight forward, concealed carry requires a bit more planning-especially if you are a man who wears a suit jacket or a blazer. 
With open-carry you wear a sturdy gun belt,  choose a comfortable holster  that fits your weapon, and you attach the holster to the belt. 
Concealed Carry With Suit Jacket of Blazer
You still want to look great while not sacrificing functionality, right?
If so, find a competent tailor who is experienced with concealed carry alterations.
Ten Basic Tips To Help You
2. Add an extra layer of lining or canvas to increase the stiffness of the bottom 12 inches of the jacket or blazer. This will reduce the signature of the firearm.
3. Add an extra ½ to 1 inch of length to the jacket in order to keep your firearm hidden when you raise your hand up into the air during conversation or to gesture.
This relates to #3 above. 
These fabrics require less care care and hide the impression of the firearm well. The downside is that these fabrics only look natural in cool weather. 
This helps conceal the contrast between your shirt and the holster. 
This helps stiffen the openings and will allow you to draw the gun faster. 
The best slight of hand to distract a casual observer from knowing you are armed is to act normal. Speak politely, mind your manners, and smile at people. "

https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-tuxedo-detail.html,"Nothing says elegant like a well fitted men’s tuxedo.
A garment reserved for formal evening occasions, it is known throughout the world by a variety of names – Smoking, Dinner Jacket, Tuxedo depending on where you reside.
A classic men’s tuxedo is what’s expected when the invitation reads Black Tie.
Harking back to a time when gentleman prepared for dinner by changing out of their foul riding clothes, the tuxedo is a simple outfit to wear as that the rules for doing so have changed little in the last century.
Below are pictures of some of our finished men’s bespoke tuxedos:
A tuxedo dress shirt is always white – although the fabric can be a plain weave broadcloth but cotton pique always looks more refined.
The shirt’s style is somewhat flexible, and in North America a turn down collar is just as acceptable as a wing collar.
The below shirt is made with an Italian cotton pique fabric, wing collar, mother of pearl buttons, and french cuffs
Here is a full view of the tuxedo or black tie dress shirt; notice the covered placket that hides the mother of pearl buttons.
Another option could have been double button holes to allow studs to hold the shirt together.
A classic bespoke black tie jacket is black (although midnight navy is equally acceptable;
White jackets are perfect for summer parties and other open air events), can be either single or double breasted, has either peak or shawl silk faced lapels, and is free from casual eccentricities such as a ticket pocket.
A close-up of the tuxedo jacket’s cuff – notice the fabric cover buttons.
Notice that this jacket has no silk facing on the lapels – a subtle option this client chose to stand out while still remaining classic.
This side photograph of the tuxedo jacket displays the majesty of the peak lapel;
 Notch lapels are often seen on formal wear, but should be avoided by any man who understands the rightful place of the peak lapel.
Also, this client has a trim profile and we built a set of darts into the coat to give a tapered fit.
Black tie trousers should always match the jacket, with a silk braid running down the side.
For those who do not want suspenders, an adjustable waistband is a great option.
Belt loops on tuxedo trousers are a sure sign of suit pants mascarading as something they are not.

https://atailoredsuit.com/garment-fit-details.html,"A Tailored Suit Garment Fit Details
Regular Fit
Our regular fit is where we like to start with all new customers. But don’t let that name fool you; it’s anything but regular. Every part of the garment we build is contoured to your body’s measurements. Generally speaking, we give you approximately 3-4 inches of room in the chest and stomach on suits and 4-5 inches of play on shirts. Compare that with the 5-7 inches commonly found in off-the-rack suits and up to 10 inches of room in off-the-rack shirts.
Loose Fit
Our loose fit isn’t really that loose, so don’t expect your clothing to be baggy (this is custom clothing we are talking about!). This is simply a roomier cut that gives the wearer a little extra fabric in key areas such as the shoulders, chest, stomach, and hips. This fit is also designed to help men minimizing certain body parts that will appear disproportional in off-the-rack clothing.
Form Fit
Not recommended for first time customer, this is for the man who likes his clothing to fit close to the body and is only recommended for men whose shoulders are wider than their stomachs. It is a fit that highlights the strength of the male chest and complements an athletic figure. Typically you see a slightly shorter jacket, a chest and stomach with only a couple of inches of room, and close fitting shoulders that display a small bump where the biceps curve out.
A Good Fit
There are three parts to a good fit.
1) We need accurate measurement to work with. Following our simple measurement guide, this is easy for anyone to do.
2) We need to accurately build your garment. Since we use a team of master tailors and have strict quality controls, this is covered.
3) We need to understand how you like your clothing to fit- specifically, how much play in key areas do you like to have.
This last point is where we need to learn from each other; most men are used to off the rack clothing and the “loose” feeling that comes with compromising on fit in one area to achieve an acceptable fit in another. If you are a first time or repeat client, we want you to know you can ask for anything to be slightly altered on future orders. Want an inch less room in the chest – no problem. Need your right sleeve cuff slightly larger to accommodate your oversized watch – done. The longer you stay with us, the more in tune we become to your idea of the perfect fit. If only all relationships could be that great!"

https://atailoredsuit.com/how-to-choose-tailor-russian.html,"Раньше портного выбирали очень просто: либо шли к тому, который обслуживал еще их отца, либо обращались за рекомендацией к знакомому продавцу мужской одежды. Сейчас же задача несколько усложнилась – все труднее становится найти хорошего портного, а среднестатистический продавец далеко не всегда владеет достаточными знаниями, чтобы рекомендовать что-то конкретное. В этой статье я постараюсь рассказать об основах выбора хорошего портного, работа которого преобразит вас и вашу одежду. Нижеследующая последовательность действий, в соответствующем порядке, поможет вам выбрать компетентного портного. Первый пункт при этом является, пожалуй, самым важным, и потом его ни в коем случае нельзя упускать. Итак.
1. Тщательно изучите основы и правила мужской одежды
Прежде чем обратиться к портному или швее, необходимо изучить основы мужского стиля. Здесь самое сложное для большинства мужчин – это выделить пару часов на чтение информации о костюмах, рубашках и других видах мужской одежды. В то же время, многие, лишь начав изучать все эти вопросы, находят такую информацию крайне интересной. Подробно изучив все вопросы мужского стиля одежды, вы начнете замечать такие детали, которых раньше и не думали; вы станете обращать внимание на подгонку пиджака по фигуре, вырезы для пуговиц и покрой брюк.
Однажды открыв для себя мир мужской одежды, вы поймете всю важность костюма и то, насколько явно он говорит окружающим о том, кто вы есть и что из себя представляете. Люди, которых вы видите лишь мельком, прохожие, знают вас только по одной детали – по одежде, которая на вас. Это единственное, по чему они могут судить о том, кто вы и что делаете в этом мире. Костюм, состоящий из пиджака, рубашки и галстука, что вы надеваете с утра, закрывает 90% вашего тела, и скажет о вас многое (в т.ч. и то, стоит ли вообще иметь с вами дело) еще до того, как вы представитесь.
Наберите значительный багаж знаний об основах мужского стиля. В этом могут помочь любые книги Алан Фласера, а также книга Николаса Антонджаванни «Мужской костюм» или «Джентельмен» Бернарда Ретцеля. Также, много полезной информации вы найдете в «Вашем гиде по стилю» компании A Tailored Suit. Как только вы заложите основы, можете смело общаться и искать советов у экспертов, а также участвовать в дискуссиях и форумах, как, например, известный форум о стиле (Style Forum) – Интернет-сообщество энтузиастов мужской одежды. Когда же вы усвоите язык и терминологию, можете смело переходить к общению с портными, чтобы выявить лучшего.
2. Важность рекомендаций работы портного и их поиск
Подходите к этому осторожно: большинство мужчин не уделяют выбору должного внимания и пользуются услугами одного определенного портного лишь потому, что не знают об иных вариантах. А если еще учесть и тот факт, что большинству неизвестно и что значит хорошая подгонка по фигуре, очень возможно, что портной, которого так расхваливают, является всего лишь счастливым обладателем невежественных покупателей. Не стоит полагать, что если кто-то лишь зовется портным или швеей, они уже знают все и вся о мужском стиле и могу на глазок правильно определить, хорошо на вас сидит одежда или не очень.
Подумайте о том, кто из ваших друзей одевается «с умом», со вкусом. У них-то и стоит просить рекомендации. Также, стоит учесть и мнение прекрасной половины человечества, однако будьте осторожны в этом: одежда для мужчин и женщин сильно отличается, в том числе и правильной посадкой на теле. Даже если, скажем, портной хорош в женской одежде, еще не значит, что он будет настолько же успешен в создании хорошего мужского костюма и что он вообще имеет для этого необходимые навыки.
3. Навыки портного в общении и обращении с покупателями
Итак, у вас уже набрался список портных. Замечательно. Следующее, что нужно сделать – начать с ними общаться, иначе говоря – провести своего рода собеседования. Вы можете сделать это по телефону или электронной почте – как угодно; главное, что задача – узнать, можно ли работать с этим человеком, есть ли у него необходимые навыки общения, слушает ли он вас или пытается лишь поскорее отвязаться или навязать свое мнение. Не стоит в то же время строго судить, если вы обратились к портному без предварительного назначения встречи – у него может быть много работы; однако любой настоящий профессионал просто обязан уметь уделить хотя бы 20 минут на разговор с потенциальным клиентом и быть готов к личной встрече в течение нескольких дней после такого разговора.
Несомненно, вам хочется иметь дело с портным, в способностях которого вы уверены. Такое решение достаточно субъективно, и в то же время, его важно принимать, исходя из знаний портного и его навыков в общении. Будет просто замечательно, если найдется такой портной, который идеально соответствует обоим критериям, однако такое бывает крайне редко, если только вы живет не в большом городе. Так, может случиться, что портной многое знает и умеет, но не способен полностью понять вас и/или считает, что он всегда прав и может игнорировать некоторые ваши пожелания. В таком случае обе стороны останутся в итоге недовольными. Потому, общение крайне важно для того, чтобы обе стороны могли понять, кто что хочет и чего имеет в виду, а также для взаимного уважения и развития долговременных взаимовыгодных отношений.
4. Когда портной должен быть доволен своей работой
Ответ один – только когда доволен покупатель! Это не значит, конечно, что опытный портной или швея всегда сможет сделать все, что вы ни пожелаете, или гарантирует совершенную безошибочность работы. Портной, с которым стоит иметь дело, скорее должен суметь понять ваши идеи и чувство стиля, и постоянно работать в этом направлении, и сделать все возможное, чтобы соответствовать этим категориям.
5. Насколько хорошо портной разбирается в стиле, который не зависит от моды и времени
Как уже говорилось ранее, не стоит полагать, что портной или швея хорошо разбираются в классическом мужском стиле по умолчанию. Хотя многие известные портные являются своего рода экспертами в создании самых невообразимых элементов одежды, их глаз может быть наметан не настолько хорошо по части, скажем, цвета ткани или стиля мужского пиджака. Кроме того, огромную роль играют культурные различия. Так, многие портные сейчас китайцы, тайцы или индийцы, работавшие у себя на родине в 70-х годах прошлого столетия; оттого их навыки могут не совсем соответствовать реалиям времени. Однако учитывая, что вы уже накопили полезный багаж знаний о мужском стиле (помните пункт 1?), вы должны суметь сразу выделить того портного, который чувствует и понимает, что такое стиль, не подверженный веяниям моды и влияниям времени.
6. Образцы работы портного – пошитые на заказ костюмы и рубашки
Фотографии, образцы, что бы то ни было – необходимо найти, увидеть и оценить примеры работы портного, которые бы доказывали заявленные знания и навыки. Если в целом костюм выглядит хорошо, потратьте время, чтобы подробнее изучить детали: хороши ли швы, насколько они ровные и прочные, насколько форма и покрой соответствует вашему представлению о том, что хотелось бы носить самому. Относитесь с опаской к тем портным, которые не могут предоставить покупателю никаких образцов и примеров своей работы.
7. Насколько легко связаться с портным и как быстро он выполняет свою работу
Заметьте, мы ничего не говорим о стоимости. Пожалуй, это наименее важный фактор при выборе портного, и даже если вы стеснены в средствах, его следует учитывать в последнюю очередь. Следует помнить, что в нашем деле главная задача – найти профессионального портного, который поможет вам воплотить в жизнь ваши представления о совершенном внешнем виде. Сэкономленные 500 рублей при результате, не соответствующем ожиданиям – пустая трата денег. Уж лучше потратить немного больше, зато получить именно то, что хочется и то, что идеально соответствует вашим представлениям."

I can’t cover everything here at RMRS — fortunately, there are other quality bloggers out there. These are the blogs I enjoy reading. We all have different opinions, of course, so some of them may recommend things that I wouldn’t, but no one on this list is going to steer you down the path of making a lethal fashion mistake – is there such a thing:)?
Check them out — it’s always smart to get multiple perspectives. After all, I don’t want everyone to dress like I do…
The Aspiring Gentleman – A very wide-ranging blog on all things traditionally “manly” from my friend Luke. His focus is on whiskey, cigars, and food, with some side trips into style and culture as well.
 The Butt Therapist – “Denim devoted debauchery” is the tagline and the summary — everything denim, all the time. Product reviews, fitting and size questions, and some good vintage-hunting tips. A great blog for jean-wearers!
Clothes on Film – Exactly what it sounds like! Analysis of style from movies, classic and contemporary, from my friend Chris over in the United Kingdom. I really like his coverage of James Bond and some of the classic black-and-white films for male readers. For more info you can check out our Clothes on Film review here at RMRS if you want.
Dappered – All men’s style, all the time. Joe and the team at Dappered.com take a lot of time and care to scour the web for amazing deals on menswear. Throughout the site you’ll find links to classic clothes for a lot less than you’d expect to pay at top retailers. He also has a great section in “ask a woman”! For more info you can see our review of Dappered here on RMRS.
Effortless Gent – A great blog on traditional styles and wardrobe-building run by my friend Barron Cuadro. He writes a lot for younger men specifically, helping out guys who are just getting out of college or getting started in life. We’ve interviewed him here on Real Men Real Style as well.
Gentleman’s Gazette – My friend Rafael’s blog has a very European perspective on men’s style. All things gentlemanly — clothes, shoes, drinks and more. A very high-end focus on some of the finer points of men’s life.
George Hahn– George writes about the good life for men, from fashion to phone apps to charities and trade shows. He also does a fantastic podcast, and has done interviews and guest posts here on RMRS more than once. One of the best sites for life-loving men out there.
The Lisbon Tailor – Very photo-driven blog with a keen eye for unique styles. As the name might suggest it’s based in Lisbon, so you’ll see all sorts of European styles here. Very frequent posts, sometimes just a single photo but always worth a look.
Magnificent Bastard – Dack and his crew run a Q&A-based blog with an enjoyably irreverent approach to style. If you find most fashion blogs to be a bit on the stuffy side you’ll enjoy Magnificent Bastard.
Man and His Razor – My friend Brian’s blog. Relatively new on the scene, it’s already got a good collection of shaving-specific articles, as the name suggests.
Men’s Flair – A few different columnists with their own takes on men’s fashion. Lots about accessories, outerwear, core wardrobe items, etc.
 Men’s Style Pro – Each post is both a general look (like “denim jackets”) and then a review/recommendation within that category. Very useful if you know what you’re generally interested in but haven’t found the right brand or model yet. Always excellent photographs, and they always link you right to the external sites you need.
Off the Cuff – Chris Hogan from Washington D.C.’s blog. A lot of product/brand-specific articles and reviews, as well as some longer, general style articles. Very detailed takes on all the products they look at.
Perfect Gentleman – Mxolisi Ngonelo , a South African gentleman’s personal take on traditional menswear. Very personable and casual writing; lots of fun to follow.
Permanent Style – Simon Crompton, a London blogger with a definite English focus. Lots of good, upscale menswear recommendations and examples here. He’s very clear and to the point in all his writing, which focuses fairly heavily on bespoke tailoring.
Primer Magazine – “A guy’s post-college guide to growing up,” specifically targeted at 20-something men, from my friend Andy. They tend to highlight some more affordable sources of good menswear, which is nice for men of any age. Grant Harris of Image Granted is their new style correspondent, and another friend of ours here at RMRS!
Street Etiquette – Contemporary, urban style blog with lots of good images and content from my friends Josh and Travis in Brooklyn. Definitely a valuable site for people venturing beyond suit-and-tie styles.
Style Girlfriend – A lady’s take on men’s style from my friend Megan. Very useful outside perspective! She’s also a Wisconsin native transported to New York, which gives her another unique outsider’s view. We’ve had her here on RMRS as a guest poster.
Suitable Wardrobe – Shorter posts on very specific menswear and men’s fashion topics from Will in San Fransisco. Very regular and frequent updates.
The Gentleman’s Standard – Glen Palmer from Detroit brings us another one with good, regular updates. From a black man’s perspective, with lots of posts specifically addressing style issues for black men.
The Houndstooth Kid – My buddy Will from Iowa, a dedicated vintage fashion blogger focused on styles from the 1930s-1950s and their uses (and descendants) today. He writes well about thrifting and finding quality vintage clothing.
The Modern Gentleman – A general men’s style blog from my friend Steve “the Mitchelli.” We like their glossary of terms, many of which come with images/illustrations.
Sharpologist – I’ve met up with Mark in Milwaukee (although he now lives in Texas) and he’s a great guy with a strong knowledge of everything that has to do with shaving. Safety razors, straight edges, getting the perfect lather on your brush – he covers it all in both video and text format. Great website – even better guy!
The Undershirt Guy – Guess what his blog specializes in? More kinds of undershirts than you ever knew existed, and the inside scoop on each from Tug. I don’t know of anyone else who has his focus on this particular topic."

https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-dress-shoes-types-russian.html,"Мужские туфли бывают разных моделей, и под каждую есть свой особый случай. Несомненно, непосредственная конструкция и цвет – вопрос личного стиля, однако существует несколько негласных правил, которые необходимо помнить при выборе туфель. В целом же, правило гласит, что чем более блестящими являются туфли, тем более они соответствуют официальному стилю; черный цвет при этом обычно считается более официальным, нежели коричневый. Туфли на шнурках также стоят выше в табели о рангах, чем такие, которые без шнурков; а закрытая шнуровка выше открытой. Брогировка – ряды или рисунки, составленные из перфорированных отверстий, снижают степень официальности, на столько, насколько обильна такая «перфорация».
Оксфордские туфли
Высший стандарт в официальном стиле – оксфордские туфли, которые имеют округлый носок и закрытую шнуровку. Такие туфли являются самым официальным вариантом для делового костюма, а также для иных серьезных случаев. Оксфордские туфли, на которых имеется частичная перфорация, сохраняют свою «официальность», особенно если идут в сочетании с костюмом из гребенной шерсти. «Оксфорды» с полной перфорацией больше подойдут к костюмам из твида и фланели. Если же в вашем гардеробе всего одна пара туфель, то этой парой, несомненно, должны быть оксфордские туфли черного цвета. Одна из лучших таких моделей – Allen-Edmonds Park Avenue.
Туфли «конец крыла»
Туфли, называемые в Америке «конец крыла», имеют перфорированный носок, с рисунком, сходящимся к центру. Бывают черного и коричневого цветов – первый для более официальных случаев, второй – более уместный в повседневном деловом стиле. В США многие ассоциируют такие туфли с президентом Рональдом Рейганом и с 80-ми гг. XX века в целом; однако и в любой другой стране такие туфли, без сомнения, обратят на себя внимание. Это вовсе не плохо, однако эта их особенность сокращает возможность их использование. В то время как традиционные «оксфорды» можно носить три дня кряду, и никто этого и не заметит; надевая туфли «конец крыла» чаще, чем раз в неделю, мужчина рискует тем, что такие туфли навсегда станут частью его образа, как в случае с президентом Рейганом.
«Дерби» и «блачеры»
Туфли «дерби» по конструкции соответствую оксфордским, однако имеют открытую шнуровку. Соответственно, такие туфли по-прежнему подходят для официальных мероприятий, и более всего – для комбинации брюки цвета хаки плюс пиджак-блейзер. «Блачеры», в свою очередь, немного более блестящие, чем «дерби», однако с тем же спектром применения. Если же такие туфли сделаны из замши или нубука, то это – просто идеальный вариант в пару к джинсами или брюкам цвета хаки.
Ботинки
Ботинки привносят некоторый налет грубости в деловой костюм, что делает их более подходящими для зимнего периода. Также их положительная особенность – удобство в надевании, и в целом – удобство в носке, делают их незаменимой обувью для путешественников, а также для тех, кому не требуется излишняя формальность «оксфордов». То же верно, с региональными поправками, в отношении ковбойских сапог. В то время как бывшие конгрессмены от Техаса как, скажем, Чарли Уилсон, могут себе позволить такую вольность, обычному мужчине скорее стоит от нее воздержаться, если только он не нефтяной магнат, владеющий вышками на побережье Мексиканского залива.
Мокасины и туфли с пряжками
Мокасины и туфли без шнурков неофициальны по определению. Подходят для повседневного делового стиля, и могут быть в различных вариантах: с металлической цепочкой по центру, с пряжкой, с фигурно-вырезанной полоской кожи по верху и т.д. В некоторых кругах даже в деловой обстановки бывают допустимы подобные туфли с кисточками, в других же, такой вариант более подходит для выходного дня.
Белые «оленьи» туфли
Белые «оленьи» туфли – это те же «оксфорды», только изготовленные из выделанной белой шкуры оленя – кожи, которая в реальности является «белой» с большой натяжкой. Они являются естественным дополнением к костюму из ткани сирсакер, а также прекрасно сочетаются с такими летними тканями как габардин телесного и лен белого цветов. Потому, они вполне подходят для деловой обстановки в летний период.
Туфли под фрак и смокинг
«Оксфорды» из лакированной кожи – самый официальный вариант мужской обуви. Они являются стандартным вариантом для смокинга и практически ни с чем больше не сочетаются. Специальные «оперные», лакированные туфли без шнурков с бантом поверх, также подходящий вариант для официального стиля.

https://atailoredsuit.com/good-mens-dress-shoes-russian.html,"Мужские туфли – самая важная деталь
Явный показатель стиля мужчины – его туфли. Так, все затраты времени, денег и усердия на то, чтобы хорошо одеться могут пойти насмарку только из-за пренебрежения к обуви.
В то время как прогресс в области производства текстиля и управления поставками в последние десятилетия значительно снизили стоимость одежды, хорошая обувь никак не подешевела. Нижний порог цены на качественные туфли и в наше время составляет около 300 долларов США; в то же время такие туфли вполне стоят своих денег. Они чрезвычайно удобны, даже когда новые, и могут прослужить от 20 лет, если о них правильно заботиться. В отличие от костюма или галстука, хорошие, качественные туфли никогда не испортят внешний вид в том плане, что даже чрезмерно официальный их вариант будет уместен в любой обстановке. Таким образом, туфли позволяют прибавить стиля обычному выходному костюму не слишком привлекая внимания тех, кто одет в шорты и футболку.
Если вы по-прежнему считаете, что потратить 300 долларов на пару туфель – это чересчур, подумайте еще раз, вспоминая типичные магазинные туфли, изготовленные из дешевой, низкокачественной кожи с приклеенной подошвой и «привлекательной» ценой в 100 долларов. Такие прослужат максимум два года, когда кожа начнет проявлять явные признаки износа, а подошва либо потрескается, либо износится; а починка будет стоить примерно столько же, сколько и новые туфли. С другой стороны, хорошие туфли за 300 долларов, изготовленные из высококачественной кожи, с накрепко пришитой подошвой могут прослужить десятилетия. В зависимости от вашего стиля ходьбы, такие туфли могут потребовать замены подошвы каждые несколько лет, что стоит всего около 60 долларов. В то же время, качественная обувная кожа только улучшает свои качества с возрастом, покрываясь слоем полироли. Поэтому, туфли за 300 долларов – инвестиции, которые будут приносить дивиденды через много лет после того, как вы уже забудете их точную стоимость.
Как правило, хорошие мужские туфли изготавливаются фирмами, которые занимаются этим как основным бизнесом. Такие фирмы включают Allen-Edmonds, Alden, John Lobb, Church’s, and Crockett & Jones. Возможно, вы никогда не слышали названия этих компаний. Это оттого, что они тратят деньги своих покупателей не на обширные и дорогостоящие рекламные кампании, а на качественные материала и искусных сапожников. Такая обувь продает себя сама безо всякой рекламы. В то же время туфли, продаваемые под известными брендами, часто изготовляются сторонними производителями из низкокачественных материалов и с низкопробной конструкцией; и не намного лучше обычных туфель, что можно найти в магазине.
После того, как вы потратились на пару качественных туфель, необходимо тщательно о них заботиться, если вы хотите, чтобы они служили вам верой и правдой долгие годы. Сразу же приобретите специальные колодки для обуви, которые вставляются в туфли после того, как вы их снимете. Они позволят туфлям сохранить их первоначальную форму, а также выветрить влагу и возможный запах. В идеале такие колодки следует держать в туфлях в течении 24 часов после каждого использования. Это означает, что мужчине надо иметь как минимум две пары туфель. Если же средства позволяют вам только одну, даже оставленные только на ночь, колодки позволят вашим туфлям противостоять износу в достаточной мере ,пока вы не приобретете дополнительную пару обуви. Надевая туфли, всегда пользуйтесь специальной обувной ложкой, чтобы предотвратить порчу кожи у задника.
И последняя важная деталь – полироль (или крем) для обуви. Неначищенная кожа выглядит сырой и будет быстро изнашиваться и трескаться. Чистка и полировка обуви занимает всего 10-15 минут на 5-6 использований, и не более минуты каждое утро на протирку пыли и грязи простой тряпочкой. Чистите туфли с колодками внутри. Сначала необходимо использовать специальный очиститель для кожи, например Kiwi Saddle Soap. Это предотвратит слои крема (полироли) от образования неприятных налетов, а также поможет сохранить кожу туфель. Затем, тщательно обработайте кожу кремом, нанося его другой тряпочкой, позвольте туфлям отстояться около пяти минут, и удалите остатки крема. Для финального штриха, тщательно отполируйте туфли чистой тряпочкой, уделяя внимание тому, чтобы обе туфли одинаково блестели.

https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-overcoats-topcoats-russian.html,"Мужское пальто С началом сезона дождей, снегов, ветров и холодов мы достаем верхнюю одежду, которая защищает от всего этого. Для мужчины, который одевается у личного портного, несомненный выбор такой верхней одежды – пальто из крепкой, плотной ткани длиной обычно до колена, с воротником и лацканами. В морозные месяцы пальто – это то, что отличает хорошо одетого мужчину от «разодетого».
Как бы ни был великолепен костюм мужчины, в случае, если он идет по улицы в куртке или пуховике поверх костюма, то этот самый пуховик и будет определять первое впечатление, которое произведет такой «джентльмен»; а костюм под таким пуховиком будет точно «не из той оперы». В то же время, даже если под шикарным пальто с шарфом будут скрываться синие джинсы и рубашка-поло, это, несомненно, произведет впечатление. Из всех видов одежды, которое мы сейчас носим, пальто за 100 лет изменилось, пожалуй, менее всего; а потому это – действительно долгосрочные инвестиции.
Из типов пальто однобортное является наиболее популярным, и этому есть своя причина. В теплые весенние и осенние деньки его можно носить без шарфа или же с шарфом, едва прикрыв им лацканы – демонстрируя всем свои рубашку и галстук. В холодное же время года, обернув дважды шарф вокруг шеи и подняв воротник, можно защититься от холода и ветра. Помимо однобортных, пальто бывают двубортными, с поясом или без него. Модели с поясом часто также называют «пальто-поло». Что до цвета, то лучший вариант, который подойдет к любому галстуку и рубашке – это черный, темно-серый и темно-синий.
Если же вам надоест однообразное строгое пальто темного цвета, есть и другие варианты.
Пальто из верблюжьего волоса (бежевого цвета) издавна были любимы аристократией северо-востока Америки благодаря непревзойденной комбинации теплоты, надежности и мягкости. Учитывая происхождение такого типа пальто, его натуральный бежевый цвет является исключением из традиционного правила «формального» сочетания цветов.
Рисунок в клетку часто можно встретить на весенних и осенних более легких моделях пальто, а также, иногда, и на более теплых. Такой вариант – прекрасный выбор для мужчины, который не боится экспериментировать с различными вариантами цветов и рисунков, позволяющий добавить стильности. Едва заметные горизонтальные полоски также хороши, как и однотонный вариант, а кроме того говорят об обладателе такого пальто как о человек, который тщательно заботиться о своей одежде.
Какое именно пальто выбрать – вопрос, прежде всего, его (пальто) теплоизоляции: чем севернее вы живете, тем более теплым должно быть пальто; и уже потом – вопрос личного стиля. Если вы не знаете с чего начать, то выбрав, к примеру, пальто черного цвета вы точно не прогадаете. Главное – найти такое, которое будет достаточно теплым.
Пальто, продающиеся в магазинах, обычно можно найти только в определенном диапазоне размеров, т.к. считается, что подгонка по фигуре менее важна для пальто, чем для пиджака. Тем не менее, многие мужчины предпочитают индивидуальный пошив этой части гардероба, т.к. это позволяет добиться не только превосходной теплоизоляции, но и идеальной посадки по фигуре. Кроме того, если у вас «нестандартное» тело и вам обычно не подходят «стандартные» магазинные размеры, то пошив пальто на заказ, несомненно, единственный правильный выбор.

https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-pocket-squares-folding-russian.html,"Мужской носовой платок: о том, как сложить платок правильно и красиво
Искусство ношения нагрудного носового платка не ограничивается знанием того, какой выбрать цвет, рисунок или ткань. Не менее важно знать, как именно его носить и складывать. Даже качественный носовой платок может выглядеть аляповато, если с ним неправильно обращаться или засунуть абы как в нагрудный карман. Однако, это не значит, что носовой платок необходимо как-то чересчур тщательно приспосабливать к карману. Многие лучшие варианты ношения носового платка предполагают его достаточно свободное положение. В то же время есть важная особенность, отличающая правильно заправленный носовой платок – особый замысел его обладателя, который предполагает, что последний намеренно предназначил платок для того, чтобы не слишком заметно подчеркнуть свой особый стиль.
Нагрудные носовые платки можно складывать множеством способов; однако, в этой статье мы рассмотрим три основных варианта: «квадрат», «фужер» и «острие».
Квадрат
 Способ складывания «квадрат», часто также называемый «президентским» или «телевизионным», является самым простым и самым недооцененным из всех. В наше время он и не слишком популярен. Этот способ очень похож на стандартный способ складывания обычного носового платка, за исключением того, что в таком случае сложенный платок должен быть достаточно длинным и узким, чтобы хорошо лежать в кармане и быть видимым снаружи. Точная длина такого платка зависит от размера кармана и предпочтений его владельца. Однако, обычно в длину он доходит до 12-15 см, а в ширину – 7-9 см. Если носовой платок изготовлен изо льна или хлопка, его следует слегка подкрахмалить, чтобы придать ему некоторую жесткость. Если из шелка – крахмалить его не следует, сгибать однако надо так, чтобы четко выделить грани.
Чтобы правильно сложить платок надо предварительно его расправить на ровной поверхности. Далее, начинайте со складывания его пополам так, чтобы его ширина осталась прежней, а в длину он стал в два раза короче. Тщательно проглаживайте грани – места сгиба ткани платка.
Далее, необходимо сложить платок – снова – пополам так, чтобы он снова представлял собой квадрат в одну четверть его первоначального размера. После чего сложите платок пополам еще раз, чтобы он был в два раза больше в длину, чем в ширину. Затем, такой сложенный платок помещается в нагрудный карман пиджака так, чтобы 1.5-3 см выступали наружу.
Сложенный платок можно помещать в карман различными способами: один из самых популярных – по диагонали. Выбор такого способа – исключительно на усмотрение обладателя платка; предварительно же стоит поэкспериментировать и подобрать оный под свой вкус и стиль.
Фужер
Следующий способ складывания платка – «фужер». Это, пожалуй, один из самых простых способов по части самого процесса складывания, и один из самых сложных по части «финального штриха».
Положив расправленный платок на ровную поверхность, возьмите его двумя пальцами по центру и поднимите вверх.
Соедините большой и указательный палец другой руки так, чтобы получилась окружность («колодец») и проденьте сквозь эту окружность платок, как бы формируя фужер.
Продевайте так, что половина ткани платка сформировала «фужер», а другая была на той стороне, с который вы тянете. После чего такой платок вставляется в нагрудный карман так, чтобы 1.5-3 см выступали наружу.
Если необходимо, можно подправить сложенный платок так, чтобы он подходил под длину и размер кармана; а если «фужер» чрезмерно длинный или короткий, можно сложить заново пока не получится так, как будет лучше выглядеть.
Острие
Ну, и, наконец, последний способ складывания нагрудного носового платка, обратный «фужеру» и предполагающий точно такой же набор действий.
Различие лишь в том, что в данном случае не «фужер» будет более длинной частью, а тот конец, за который вы протягивали платок сквозь «колодец». В фотографиях на этой странице вы можете наглядно видеть всю последовательность операций по складыванию платка с двумя остриями. Есть множество других способов, однако этот – наиболее подходит для официальной, консервативной обстановки и он лишь немногим более стильный, чем платок, сложенный по способу «квадрат».
Подправьте сложенный платок по необходимости по длине и так, чтобы его концы не находились слишком близко друг к другу.
Этот способ складывания может потребовать более сильного подкрахмаливание льняного и хлопкового платков, чтобы их концы могли сохранять заданную форму. Более свободный вид платку можно придать посредством его встряхивания после того, как вы его взяли двумя пальцами по центру – до создания «фужера».
Каждый способ складывания имеет свои особенности и свои достоинства, позволяет создать определенный отличительный образ джентльмена его использующего. Лучший способ найти свой идеальный вариант – попробовать все возможные комбинации и выбрать тот, который наиболее подходит вашему собственному стилю и костюму.

https://atailoredsuit.com/mens-suit-colors-russian.html,"Мужской костюм: к вопросу о цвете
Первое, что замечается в мужском костюме, – еще до его модели, посадки, количества пуговиц и пропорций, – его цвет. Первое впечатление очень важно и крайне сильно, поэтому очевидно, что нелегко определить какой именно цвет выбрать для своего костюма. Однако, не стоит отчаиваться: как и во всем остальном, классический стиль имеет здесь свои простые определенные правила, изучив которые, можно забыть о сложностях при выборе цвета.
Прежде всего, необходимо запомнить, что когда дело доходит до костюмов, не все цвета равны. Существуют как цвета, подходящие для любого случая, так и такие, которые будучи уместными на одном мероприятии, будут совсем не к месту на другом. Также, следует учесть, что некоторые цвета могут подходить только для определенного сезона, а другие – иметь особое значение, не учитывая которое можно попасть в крайне неловкое положение
Единственный костюм
Единственный костюм – для тех, кому приходится надевать таковой не слишком часто. Обычно это один «свадебно-похоронный» костюм, т.к. носят его тогда, когда правилами этикета иное однозначно возбраняется. В подобном случае, костюм должен быть таков, чтобы подходить для как можно большего числа мероприятий – куда бы не занесло его обладателя. Темный костюм консервативных цветов – черного, темно-синего или угольно-серого – будет самым лучшим вариантом для этого.
Когда есть возможность иметь более чем один костюм
Предыдущий случай достаточно прост. Перейдем теперь к палитре цветов, среди которых можно выбирать тем, кто носит костюм на регулярной основе. Пусть вкусы дизайнеров меняются с молниеносной быстротой, заставляя костюмы и их обладателей выглядеть устаревшими и не «в русле» – традиционный мужской костюм всегда остается одинаково элегантным и стильным: его возраст уже давно перевалил за годы, а то и десятилетия. Важность классического костюма особенно высока в таких официальных сферах деятельности, как то политика, финансы, юриспруденция; однако же, и в целом, для любой иной профессии, где желателен традиционный классический внешний вид.
Угольно-серый, черный и темно-синий цвета
Традиционные цвета мужского делового костюма – черный, темно-синий и серый. Гардероб любого джентльмена должен включать несколько костюмов таких темных цветов, т.к. они подходят практически для любого случая. Выбор конкретного цвета из этих трех зависит от предпочтений владельца, однако лучше всего будет иметь по одному костюму каждого из основных цветов – угольно-серого, черного и темно-синего. Первый – превосходный цвет для молодого мужчины потому, что в отличие от темно-синего не заостряет внимание на юном возрасте. Такой костюм крайне универсален и может сочетаться в зависимости от оттенка серого, со многими элементами как черного, так и коричневого цветов.
Черный костюм выигрывает за счет своей схожести с официальной одеждой (фраком, смокингом), а также за счет подчеркивания авторитетности его обладателя. Темно-синие костюмы, в свою очередь, также превосходный выбор: благодаря их традиционной популярности можете быть спокойны – как минимум половина мужчин на предстоящем мероприятии будет именно в костюмах этого цвета. Помимо этого, темно-синий – традиционный и очень элегантный цвет, и такой костюм стоит приобрести в дополнение к другим при первой же возможности. Для любого из этих цветов подходит рисунок ткани в полоску; в то же время ее присутствие обычно несколько снижает уровень официальности костюма. Не стоит однако беспокоиться по этому поводу – для бизнеса такой вариант будет очень кстати.
Коричневый цвет
Коричневый – еще один популярный цвет среди основных цветов мужского костюма. Может варьироваться от песочного до цвета темного шоколада. Многие мужчины лучше всего смотрятся в костюмах земляного оттенка коричневого, потому такой костюм может стать неотъемлемой частью гардероба. Кроме того, это очень популярный цвет для повседневных мероприятий – именно коричневыми обычно бывают костюмы из твида и спортивные пиджаки. Интересная деталь: до начала 1980-х годов коричневый не рассматривался как цвет для делового костюма.
В наше время, хотя многое изменилось, и такой костюм теперь считается вполне уместным, все равно остаются «старообрядцы», которые по-прежнему чтут это старинное правило. Не стоит обращать на это чрезмерного внимания и отказываться от коричневого цвета, однако все же важно помнить этот факт, чтобы не попасть впросак (например, на интервью на работу, дипломатическом приеме и т.д.).
Помимо традиционных «деловых» на выбор заботящегося о своем внешнем виде джентльмена существует огромное количество и других цветов. Так, коричневый твид взывает к воспоминаниям о холодном, дождливом утре в английской провинции; в то время как ткань цвета слоновой кости вызывает ассоциации со знойными тропиками. Полосы, клетка, а также другие типы рисунков – существует много различных вариантов, заслуживающих отдельного разговора.
Главным же принципом, влияющим на выбор среди всего этого многообразия, является хорошее сочетание личной цветовой гаммы – цвета волос, глаз, кожи – с цветом костюма. По непонятной причине очень многие не понимают, что одежда, подчеркивающая достоинства цветовой гаммы одного человека, может быть совсем не подходить таковой у другого. В то же время, очень важно обращать самое пристальное внимание на то, что именно подчеркивает или скрывает определенный цвет одежды.
Безусловно, самый правильный способ подобрать цветовую гамму – путем проб и ошибок; в то же время существуют несколько общих правил для задания общего направления в этом деле. Кроме того, при примерке перед зеркалом необходимо учитывать одну крайне важную деталь – освещение, т.к. ткань может иметь разные оттенки, к примеру, при флюоросцентном и дневном свете. Поэтому необходимо все это учитывать и подбирать цвет костюма в таком освещении, в котором костюм, собственно, и планируется большей частью использовать.

Особые случаи: необходимость учитывать особенности телосложения
Такие традиционные цвета мужского костюма как черный, серый и темно-синий подходят, в принципе, для мужчин, имеющих любую цветовую гаммы. Большее влияние этот фактор имеет на подбор рубашки, галстука и прочих аксессуаров. Потому, большинству джентльменов не стоит сильно беспокоиться об этом, если они надевают костюм таких традиционных оттенков. Тем же, цветовая гамма которых отличается высокой контрастностью – прежде всего людям с очень темными волосами и светлой кожей, а также темнокожим, стоит подойти к вопросу выбора цвета более основательно.
Определенные цвета имеют свойство нивелировать черты или совсем их «затмевать».
Джентльменам со светлой кожей и темными волосами лучше всего пойдут темные, богатые цветом костюмы, которые будут вместе с темными волосами своего рода «обрамлять» светлые черты. Также неплохо будут смотреться светлые костюмы оттенков светло-серого и песочного, которые снижают контрастность и яркость светлого цвета кожи. Темнокожие будут лучше выглядеть в темных или светлых тонах в зависимости от конкретного оттенка кожи.
Так, темный костюм со светлой рубашкой идеально подойдет джентльмену с очень темной кожей, создавая приятную глазу контрастность. В то же время, лишь загорелому, смуглому мужчине больше подойдет рубашка более темных тонов в сочетании с темным костюмом – это позволяет добиться более теплой тональности. Ну а мужчинам со светлой кожей можно рекомендовать светлые костюмы земляных оттенков, которые будут превосходно сочетаться с неконтрастной цветовой гаммой.
Итак, рассмотрев и изучив цветовые вариации, мы можем смело идти вперед, к более сложным категориям. Далее – о рисунке костюмной ткани.
