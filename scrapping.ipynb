      "all Get Skilled                      in: Family, Featured, People  Brett and Kate McKay  • January 25, 2023The Best Riddles for Kids (With Answers!)                                 Looking for a way to while away the time with your kids while you’re waiting for your food at a restaurant or cruising on a road trip, but don’t want to resort to using a smartphone to entertain them?Take part in a good old riddle showdown.Riddles aren’t only fun, but they can help boost your children’s verbal fluency,  problem-solving skills, and creative thinking. Riddles, and other brain teaser-type verbal puzzles,  typically rely on clever new angles to look at something common, or on words with veiled or multiple meanings.Riddles for Kids: Some Ground RulesRiddles should be fun, and to make sure the riddles you share with your kids are fun, it’s best to follow a few ground rules.Rule #1: The riddles have to be in the language the kids involved speak. So, if the kids you’re riddling speak English, make sure the riddle can be understood in that language.Rule #2: Give the kids a theme to orient them in the right direction. So, give them a head’s up that you’re giving them an animal riddle when the answer involves an animal. Let them know they’ll have to think in numbers when you give them a math riddle. In every way you can, give the kids the best chance to stay engaged and work hard at solving the riddles. If you’re going to be giving them a particularly tricky riddle, go ahead and let them know ahead of time.Rule #3: Let them know it’s ok not to know things. For example, to answer most riddles, your kid needs to know what the words in the riddle mean and their various applications. For example, when you ask, “What has a head, a foot, and four legs?” your kiddo needs to know that the concept of “legs” applies not only to animals but to beds. If they don’t know that, well, the riddle is a way for you to teach them and expand their perspective and vocab.The Art of Manliness’s Collection of Riddles for KidsBelow you’ll find 44 riddles for kids. Some of them are classics (“What’s black and white and read all over?” The answer is not a zebra.); some may be new to you. Some are hilarious jokes disguised as riddles; others are reliant on puns. There’s also a nice mixture of easy, medium, and hard riddles, so you’ll find puzzles for all ages and abilities here.After you’ve read these, be sure to check out the 54 best jokes for kids of all ages.

      "                                 There are three items of clothing that arguably constitute the trifecta of the most classic style staples for men: denim jeans, white tees . . .and the Oxford-cloth button-down shirt (aka, the OCBD).The Oxford shirt was inspired by the way 19th century British polo players buttoned down the collars of their shirts so the fabric wouldn’t flap in their faces and was introduced in the United States by Brooks Brothers in 1896.Since then, the OCBD has served as a simple, handsome cornerstone of the male wardrobe.Comfortable, durable, versatile, and practically fool-proof to pull off, Oxford shirts can be worn year-round, and in nearly any time and place. Getting some is one of the easiest ways to start dressing better, and they could even become part of your personal uniform.If you don’t already have this shirt in your closet, or have been underutilizing the ones you do own, today we’ll offer a guide on how to wear the Oxford with style.What Is an Oxford Shirt?Oxford shirts are a type of men’s dress shirt.Dress shirts are defined by having a collar, cuffs, and a full-length, button-fastened opening at the front.Dress shirts can be divided into “button-ups” and “button-downs.” You can, in fact, button up the plackets of both of these types of shirts. The difference refers to the collar; on a button-up, the collar is unadorned and unattached to the shirt, whereas on the button-down, the ends of the collar include a single button that can be fastened to the front of the shirt.The Oxford shirt is a type of button-down that is made with Oxford cloth. Woven with a basket-weave pattern, Oxford cloth has a unique look and feel and is coarser and heavier than the thinner, smoother, shinier fabric used to make more formal dress shirts. The Oxford-cloth button-down shirt is also distinguished by its soft, unlined collar and cuffs and typically sports a chest pocket.How to Choose an OxfordFabric. While some Oxford shirts are made with poly/cotton blends these days, a classic OCBD is 100% cotton, and a pure cotton Oxford will look, feel, and breathe better. 100% cotton Oxfords will sometimes need to be ironed, but the thick fabric doesn’t excessively wrinkle, and the shirt doesn’t need too much pressing; a little rumpledness is part of its DNA. You might be able to get away with just tumbling it in the dryer (though hanging it to dry is preferred) and removing it promptly, and if you’re going for a particularly insouciant look, then don’t iron it at all.There are “non-iron” 100% cotton Oxfords that are soaked in formaldehyde during manufacture, a process which permanently alters the fabric, making it wrinkle-resistant. These shirts will be easier to care for, but the non-iron finish makes the fabric less soft, breathable, and durable.Color. The most classic colors of the OCBD are white and light blue, and they also often come in pastel hues. Start your collection with white and blue, and then branch out from there by getting, say, a pink one (yes, you can pull off pink). Length. Oxford shirts can be worn tucked or untucked, and if you’re planning on doing both, make sure the shirt is long enough to stay tucked in, but not so long that it’ll look sloppy when untucked.Fit. Oxfords come in both regular and slim fit varieties, and which you prefer is up to you. Regardless, an OCBD shouldn’t feel restrictive and should be roomier than a formal dress shirt. A button-up shirt is designed to be worn under things (like a suit jacket); a button-down may be worn under other garments but is also designed to stand on its own. How to WearButton-down shirts are more casual than button-ups, and the thicker, rougher fabric of an Oxford makes it particularly casual. Yet by nature of its structured, dress-shirt style, it’s still a versatile piece of clothing that can be worn in classier settings and dressed up or down. Note: There aren’t hard lines between these dress code categories, e.g., an Oxford with more tailored chinos and dressier shoes can be business casual; swap the nicer chinos and shoes for more laid-back khakis and chukkas, and it’s smart casual; swap the chukkas for athletic sneakers, and it’s plain casual. When it comes to styling something very basic like the OCBD, little differences in what you pair it with it and how you accessorize it will make an outfit more or less appropriate for a particular setting.Business CasualStyle traditionalists would advise against wearing an Oxford button-down shirt with a suit, as the shirt’s casualness clashes with the suit’s formality. However, this isn’t a hard and fast rule, and an OCBD can be worn with a suit if you desire, particularly if it’s of the less formal, less business-y variety (more texture, less structure).But Oxfords are really best for all the style categories that sit below the semi-formal range. When it comes to occasions that call for something that’s a step down from that dress code but still polished and/or professional, Oxfords look great with chinos, a sports jacket or blazer, and more casual dress shoes like semi-brogue derbies, long-wing derbies, and suede bucks.  Or throw a sweater over your Oxford and pair with some trousers.Go tie-less, or opt for a more casual textured tie. If you choose to wear a tie, because the gap between the points of the collar is smaller on an Oxford, use a smaller tie knot like the simple or four-in-hand rather than a bigger knot like the Windsor or half-Windsor.  Smart CasualSmart casual — sometimes called for for wedding rehearsal dinners, dates, and work conferences — can be a hard dress code to decipher. Going with an Oxford, some chinos, and leather boots/shoes or suede chukkas is a pretty fail-proof way to navigate it. Wearing your OCBD with nice jeans or corduroy pants would make the look a little more casual, but could work too. During the colder months, throw a sweater on top of your Oxford for a handsome and put-together get-up.Oxfords are perfect for when you work at an office that’s pretty laid-back, but you want to look more put-together than your polo and t-shirt-wearing peers, and it transitions smoothly from the cubicle to an after-work dinner or hangout at a bar.CasualOxford shirts are comfortable enough to be worn when you’re just banging around — when you’re not doing anything particularly special but don’t want to look like a slob, either.Wear an OCBD untucked with casual jeans and sneakers, or even shorts and boat shoes (if you’re going for a preppy look), and you’re ready for a day of errands, hanging out at a friend’s house, or grabbing a quick bite to eat. An Oxford shirt can be thrown on over a t-shirt as well.The more casual you’re getting, the more buttons you can unbutton (though you need not go so low as to show chest hair), and don’t forget to roll your sleeves up to add to your laid-back vibe. Oxford shirts look and feel even better as you break them in. So get one, or several, for your wardrobe, and start wearing the heck out of ’em!Related PostsHow to Tie the Simple Necktie KnotHow to Tie a Full Windsor Knot: An Illustrated GuideHow to Tie a Four-in-Hand Necktie Knot: Your 60 Second Visual GuideSkill of the Week: Tie the Half-Windsor Necktie KnotTie Tips: A Visual GuideHow to Match a Shirt and Tie          Previous Next         \n"

      "Camping is one of America’s favorite pastimes. About 50 million Americans head out into the wilderness each year to refresh and reinvigorate themselves. While it may seem like camping as a recreational activity has always been around, camping as we know it today is actually relatively new. For most of human history, camping is what you did during war or on a hunting or fishing expedition. It wasn’t something you just did for fun in and of itself. So how did camping become a modern pastime?My guest today explores the answer to this question in his latest book. His name is Terence Young and he’s the author of Heading Out: A History of American Camping. Terry and I begin the show discussing how camping got its start as an anti-modern revolt after the Civil War, and the New England minister who wrote a book that would kickstart the camping craze in America in the 19th century. Terry then shares how businesses responded to the growing number of campers in America by creating and marketing products and goods to make camping easier, and how these products began a debate about which sort of camper is the most authentic camper — a debate which remains today. We end our conversation talking about the rituals of camping, why all campsites in America look exactly the same, and the state of camping today. This is a great episode to listen to on your way to a weekend camp trip, or when you’re dreaming of your next outing on the way to work.Show HighlightsWhen did camping become a recreational activity? (It’s later than you probably think!)Why did people start camping for its own sake?How camping fit into the broader arts and crafts movementThe book that kickstarted the camping crazeWhat camping was like in the 19th centuryHow the conservation movement — including John Muir — reacted to campingHow the camping gear industry was bornThe everlasting debate about “real” campingThe ritual of the campfireHow the automobile poured gas on the American camping flameThe genesis of America’s campsite infrastructure, and how the modern campground was designedThe long trail movement (Appalachian Trail, Pacific Crest Trail) and the rise of backpackingHow American camping is unique from other countriesThe state of camping in America todayResources/People/Articles Mentioned in PodcastW.

Well, camping is one of America’s favorite past times. About 50 million Americans head out into the wilderness each year to refresh and reinvigorate themselves. While it may seem like camping is a recreational activity that’s always been around, camping has no today because it’s actually reality new. For most of you in history, camping is what you did during war, or on a hunting or fishing expedition. It wasn’t something you just did for the fun of it, just in and of itself.So, how did camping become a modern past time? My guest to explore the answer to this question in his latest book. His name is Terence Young and his book is entitled ‘Heading Out: History of American Camping’. Terry begins our show discussing how camping got a start as an anti modern revolt after the Civil War and the New England minister who wrote a book that would kick start the camping craze in America in the 19th century. Terry then shares how business respond to the growing number of campers in America by creating and marketing products and goods to make camping easier, and how these products began a debate about which sort of camper is the most authentic kind, a debate that remains ongoing today.We end our conversation talking about the rituals of camping, why all campsites in America look exactly the same, or pretty much, in the state of camping in American today. This is a great episode to listen to on your way to a weekend camping trip or when you’re dreaming of your next outing on the way to work. After the show is over, check out the show notes at AON.IS/HeadingOut.Terence Young, welcome to the show.Terence Young: Oh, thank you. It’s great to be here.Brett McKay: So, you wrote a history of one of my all time favorite activities, camping. And really, after reading this book, I’m looking at camping now with completely new eyes. I’m looking at campsites differently, because I know why campsites look the way they do and why there’s the one way loop and all that thing. But, what I found most interesting about this book was that, for some reason, I always thought of camping as sort of this er recreational activity, right? This sort of thing that humans have always done for fun for a long time but, then, when you think about it it’s like, “That doesn’t make any sense.”So, you point out in the book that camping for the sake of camping is actually a relatively new concept. So, when did camping become just an activity that people just did for the sake of doing it?Terence Young: Well, as you say Brett, camping is, in a sense, is ancient. Probably as long as there have been people, people have camped but, they didn’t camp for fun. They camped because they had to. The idea of camping, actually the word comes from the military word ‘campaign’, to engage in a campaign and they had to set up encampments and so, there were camps. Like, camp Lagune or things like this.Camping as a recreational activity, in some ways, initially came along, at least in America, with hunting and fishing but, hunters and fishers would go out to do that, hunt and fish. But, they had to camp as a kind of adjunct to hunting and fishing. It’s only after the US Civil War ended in 1865 that we start to see people going camping just to camp, that they might hunt and fish. There were still many people still going hunting and fishing and then had to camp. But, this is when they first see the appearance of the idea, that camping itself is a form of recreation.Brett McKay: So, I’m curious. I mean, what was it about coast velum America, the cultural melou of it that made people start camping just for camping sake?Terence Young: The northern part of the country boomed. The economy boomed and industry was growing and the cities like, New York, Boston, Hartford, Philadelphia, they were growing very rapidly in population and getting much larger. Along with this industrialization and urbanization of America came a lot of regulation, a lot of pollution, noise, smoke, things like this. A lot of crowding, a lot of strangers that people didn’t know.This was all knew to Americans. There had been cities like New York before the Civil War but they largely had been relatively small and the vast majority of Americans had lived in small towns and on farms and tiny settlements and stuff. And this new experience caused a sort of, I would say, identity crisis, if you will, amongst people who weren’t sure. Who am I, in a way, and is this still America?One of the things, amongst many, that they turned to was camping. Camping going back with this kind of romantic idea of nature as relief, as whatever solution, anidine to their sense of like, “Am I really in the right place being here in the city?” They didn’t want to leave the city because that’s where the jobs were, that’s where the money was. But, they wanted some relief from the city and camping seemed to fill the bill.Brett McKay: Right, so in a way it was an anti modern revolt? In a sort of-Terence Young: Yes.Brett McKay: But yeah, you said this was among other things. This was sort of … Besides camping, I know during this same period, people got really into arts and crafts. This is like when the arts and crafts movement started in Europe and America and people were all about “I’m going to build things with my hands and rustic things are great things because it’s not tainted by urbanization or technology.”Terence Young: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, that’s right and we do … One of the reasons the arts and crafts movement rose was because people were increasingly in jobs where they didn’t make anything from beginning to end, right? They, whatever, made a part that was assembled into something larger and so, they didn’t necessarily see a completion to their actions. They came enamored of this idea of doing things themselves, and having control and finishing something. Camping is a part of that whole larger movement.Brett McKay: Right. One of the individuals, most influential individuals in sort of kick starting the camping movement in America, never heard of this guy but he’s a pretty interesting character. His name is William HH Murray. What was it about his book that he wrote? It’s called ‘Adventures in the Wilderness’, that helped kickstart the camping craze?Terence Young: Well, Murray, for a little background on him. Murray was a congregationalist minister from Boston. He was actually the head of the Park Street Church, which is probably the most significant, or was the most significant, congregational church in America. He was a graduate of Yale. He was very educated gentleman. He was a very enthusiastic outdoors man. He especially loved canoeing and, the thing about his book, his book is, I think, kicks off camping for a number of reasons.One, it’s accessible, it’s still in print. It’s well written. He’s funny. He’s sort of self reflectively funny. But most importantly, unlike anybody before him, he basically came right out and flatly said, “Well, how do you camp?” He told people how to do it. Writers before him hadn’t really said that. They just assumed everyone knew how. Of course, most urban people in 1869, when ‘Adventures in the Wilderness’ was published, most urban people they didn’t have any idea about how to go camping into the wild. They lived in the city.His book told them how. You needed to go here, do that. He told them where to go into the Adirondacks in particular. And he told them why. I think that why was also very important because what he did was, he addressed the anxieties that urban people in the post Civil War era were feeling. He came right out and said, “Yes, the reason you don’t feel good is, you work in an office, it’s crowded, your boss is a pain.” These sorts of things and he was the first one to come right out and say it and he was a minister saying this.I think it gave him a lot of clout, you know? It’s a combination of a well written book, useful book, informative book, and one that explained why you’d want to go camping. People took him at his word and immediately took off and started camping.Brett McKay: How much of an impact did this book have? Like, how many people started camping because of him and how did it change he Adirondacks and the economy there, and just the amount of people there?Terence Young: It’s hard to say exactly how many people were effected directly by Murray’s book but, we know that he made a fortune on the book. He made $25,000 in the first year off sales of the book. This is at a time when the average, or per capita income in the US, is under $200 a year. So, he made an enormous amount of money, so then we know lots of copies were sold. In the Adirondacks, they directly felt it in the year prior to his book coming out. A couple of hundred people showed up as Sandarac Lack during the whole season to go into the back woods and stuff. The year that Murray’s book is written, 1869 that it’s published, they got at least two to 3,000 people. So, they had a 10 to 15 time increase in the number of people camping.Then, the following year, 1870, there was at least 5,000 people or more show up. So, this is a tremendous increase in the number of people going to the Adirondacks.Brett McKay: What was camping like at this time? I mean, who were the type of people going and how did they get there and what kind of stuff did they bring for them to camp?Terence Young: Well, relatively few people actually go camping, compared to the total size of the population in the 19th century. This is for a bunch of reasons but particularly it’s mostly upper middle class people who can go camping. That’s largely because you had to have a lot of money, it’s not cheap to go camping in 1880 say, and you needed time. Most Americans didn’t have vacations in the 19th century, most working Americans. So, you had to have your own business or profession, or be able to sell or save enough money to be able to do this so, class people and a few wealthy people that are going.They didn’t take much gear. There wasn’t much gear that we would … The kind of things that we would think of today, just most of them didn’t exist in the 19th century. So, what they would take was relatively heavy and cumbersome and difficult to move around, which means there were not a lot of people who walked as campers, like backpacking, just handful of them. There’s a fair number of people who went on horseback or in canoes, things like this.Again, a few who would go with a horse and wagon, but horse and wagon was very expensive and you had to sort of get a bunch of people together to do it. When they went camping, mostly, they went nearby. They would, just say, take the train two stops past the edge of town, get off, walk out along some river and into the edge of a farm field and plop down and start camping. They were perfectly happy to just go, basically, near by. Only the wealthy, I mean and the truly wealthy, could go long distance to some place like Yellow Stone or Yosemite or something like that. Since most of the people who are camping at this time, in the 19th century, course live in the north eastern part of the US, and Yellow Stone is a long way away. So, you had to have a lot of time and money to do that.Brett McKay: Yeah, and during this time, after Murray’s book, this whole marketplace for camping literature just sprung up. Articles started proliferating in magazines about camping. I know you said they talked about the benefits, as it’s a way to recoup from the stressful like of the city but, even though this was primarily an upper middle class activity, one of the benefits that these publishers pushed, or these writers pushed, was that camping was economical. It was like an economic recreational activity.Terence Young: Yes. I mean, it is a common troupe here because I’m sure people were cautious. Somebody would say, “You should go camping for two weeks or a month.” And they’re going, “Yeah, but that’s extra costs.” So, there was many, as you point out, there were many articles that were published saying, “Oh no, no. It’s so inexpensive to go camping that, in fact, you can keep your house and go camping and your overall expenses will be reduced or, at least, no higher than what you’re already experiencing because you can catch your food. You can go out and catch fish, you don’t have to buy meat.” Something like this. You don’t need to buy fuel, you can just get the fuel from the forest, or something along those lines.So, yeah, there was a lot of effort to sort of condense people to don’t worry. This is not going to cost you a great deal of money. Also, it’s in the light of people who, of this class, who one of the things they would typically do on vacations, if they had the time and money, was they would go to hotels. Say, in Saratoga or something like this, and that’s very expensive to do, to have a room for two weeks and eat at one of these places. So, camping, people who promoted camping, were situating it in this sort of like, “Yeah, you can do all those things but, you do this, you’ll have a better time and it won’t cost you so much.”Brett McKay: You just said they just kind of plop their tent wherever. So, at this time, there still wasn’t an infrastructure for camping. Did conservationist … Because this is when the conversation movement was starting to pick up. Was they considered about the effect that campers were having on the environment and on forest because of their sort of indiscriminate camping?Terence Young: Generally speaking, no. I’ve come across very little in the kind of like, “Be careful” or anything like that. Or, “Gosh, we have to control the campers.” Although, having said that, there are people who do note that there’s problems from this. The forest service, when it first gets money, the US Forest Service, when it first gets money to develop camping facilities it does so as an effort to prevent fires. Or, the park service, and one of the things the park service did, the rangers did, most commonly at first was give people tickets for leaving fires unattended. Fire was a particularly special concern.John Mouer, again as unsurprisingly, one of the things he noted in the late 19th century was that campers were polluting streams. He was one of the first people to sort of mention it and he, in fact, used it as part of his campaign against Hechthechie and Yosemite Park. But, generally speaking, conservationist didn’t seem much concerned with the impacts of campers.Brett McKay: Yeah, they might have probably liked it because it got people in nature and maybe helped promote the cause a bit. Like, “Oh, this is nice.”Terence Young: Yeah.Brett McKay: How did the market respond to America’s camping craze because whenever there’s a craze in America there’s always a company out there trying to capitalize on that. So, what sort of businesses popped up during this time that catered to campers?Terence Young: Well, I think you can sort of put them into three kinds of groups. One is, there were lots of small companies popped up to provide all sorts of items, whether those were, say imagine if you will, before there’s much camping equipment people had to mostly bring plates that would be ceramic or, they would bring cookware that didn’t fit into each other and stuff.So, initially companies sprang up to sort of say, “Okay look, we can sell you cutlery that fits inside your cups, which can be stacked together and all of these pots and pans, they can all be nested together.” They basically … These companies tried to provide greater convince and comfort and they made all sorts of things, all kinds of efforts at cooling, ice chest, there’s ice chest in the 19th century. Cookware in particular is one of the things that people go after. Clothing manufacturers are trying to provide. Tents.But most of these companies, they made a product and then they pretty much disappeared. They didn’t last very long for whatever variety of reasons. In addition to them, there were businesses which recognize … Which already had a product and then, recognized that their product had a new market, potential for a new market, that was campers. So, for instance, Ivory Soap, which was the company that initially made Ivory Soap begins in 1840, long before camping and they’re selling soap to people in homes and stuff like that. But then, in the mid to late 19th century, campers come up and Ivory starts promoting its product to campers. It’s clean, it can clean anything, it floats, you’re not going to lose the bar of soap if you start washing in the stream. There’s a variety of these kinds of companies.Eagle Brand condensed milk is another one that again and again they say, “We have a product. Let’s market it to campers too.” And a lot of these, you can still … If you go into camping supply store or sporting good stores, you still find products made by companies that generally you don’t think of as camping companies but they make a product that fits camping and gets sold in a sporting goods store.Then, lastly, there are those businesses which sprang up and continue and lasted. They sprang up to make a product for campers and they’ve lasted all the way through. The one I always think of and remember most is Air Stream Trailers, say. Now, they’re the beginning of the 20th century but, Air Stream was one of many trailer companies, most of which failed ultimately, but there they are still putting out Air Streams and people still loved them.Yeah, I mean, after about 1880, there’s a real awareness that camping is a market, that there’s a big market of campers and you don’t want to pass them up.Brett McKay: Yeah, but what this … The market introduce all these comforts, they introduce this debate that we still see amongst campers, right?Terence Young: Yes.Brett McKay: About what is real camping. Like, backpackers will say, “Well no, we’re the legit campers because we just take everything we need in. Don’t bring anything out.” The car campers think, “Well we’re better than the trailer campers because at least we’re sleeping in a tent.” Did this debate exist back then, in the early days of camping?Terence Young: Oh yes. Right from the very beginning. I think if we recognize, or we accept the idea, that camping is a sort of anti modern activity and that part of the modern world is technologies. One of the reasons I think campers divide along these different mode, lines of modes, backpacking, trailer camping, canoe camping, car camping. I think one of the reasons they do that is, they are willing to accept different levels of technological presence in nature with them. That tension has never ended.I mean, totally. I mean, I feel it myself. I love to go camping and I’m sure I’ve made more than one observation that, “Well I would never use that kind of equipment” or something. But, camping is … Sort of, camping is what campers do. You know, if they’re happy with it and they feel good about it and it satisfies them, I think we have to accept that it is camping. Might not be the kind of camping that I or somebody else would care to practice and maybe I wouldn’t feel the pleasure and the relief and release from camping in somebody else’s mode with a trailer, with a backpack, or whatever. Never the less, I think it’s clear that the people who do use those kinds of technologies, they are enjoying themselves. They are having a good time. It does work for them. But, it doesn’t make them anymore satisfied with the other kinds of camping.Brett McKay: Right, now there’s a lot of ritual around camping, even today, right? First thing you do get to a spot, you pitch your tent. Then, you get the fire going. Then, maybe you have a chuck box, you get that going. Were these rituals started back in the 19th century when camping was first getting going?Terence Young: In the 19th century, there’s not so much of that. But, in the 20th century, at the very beginning, late end of the 19th, very beginning the 20th century, it starts to appear. You start to see it in magazines and in how to books, and stuff like this because you start to see articles appearing in, say, winter time in a magazine. Lady’s Home Journal or something like this, Popular Mechanics or something, talking about well now summer is coming. You want to get ready for that camping trip. You got to start planning it. You got to start thinking about it.I think we see this, and this is not exclusive to camping, I think. But at the beginning of the 20th, end of the 19th century they start to … There’s this literature that says imagination is the first thing you do, is image where you’re going to go. Then, you plan it. Then assemble it all and finally, when you’re going to go and get out there. But, the one activity that I think has become most identified, I think with camping, one of those rituals, which does go right back to the very beginning is a camp fire. I mean, you can see people talking about “Be sure to have a camp fire.” Right in the 1870s, right after Murray’s book and virtually every first early books written about camping. They’ll illustrate them with camp fires, people standing around camp fires. It’s clearly something that has a strong ritual meaning for campers, no matter what kind of mode they practice.Brett McKay: Yeah. That was interesting too, you bring up this point, by the early 20th century the frontier in America pretty much closed. All the states that were once territories were states. I live in Oklahoma. 1907 Oklahoma was a state. Few years later, Arizona was a state. So, there’s this closing of the frontier. How did that closing of the frontier effect how Americans viewed camping?Terence Young: Well, this idea, which was made, whatever, widely known by Fredrick Jackson Turner, the historian, 1890s. When people came to think of the frontier as closing it wasn’t until it was going away that they came to think “This is how we became Americans.” The frontier was the place where immigrants from other countries, other parts of the world, other parts of America, they’d move out on to the frontier and even if they weren’t true Americans in a way, the interaction between them and the frontier left Americans behind. That it created Americans. So, it was people interacting with the American frontier.Well, when it is officially declared gone and closed, camping becomes much more of a … It starts to be presented in literature as, “Look, this is how you got to get to the frontier. This is all that’s left. We don’t have that actual frontier anymore but we do have wild places.” What do you do? You go camping. It’s the closest thing we’re going to be able to do. Importantly, you take your children to go camping too because this is how you can be sure that they’ll get that experience that your forebears, that the pioneers, had. They’ll have that same experience and they’ll end up being rugged and tough and self supporting and this sort of thing. So, camping sort of got kicked up a notch culturally, by this idea that the frontier was gone.Brett McKay: Right, and another idea of the frontier thesis was that the frontier is what made democracy work in America, right? Because the frontier, you could go out and everyone was pretty much the same, whether you were a banker from east or some rough neck or cowboy, you were sort of on the level because you were out facing nature with each other.Terence Young: Yes. This is, again, a common sort of recognition on the part of individual campers. You can find it in their diaries talking about meeting people of all sorts of walks of life and being really pleased and getting along with them. They could go camp in Yellow Stone or Yosemite or Great Smoky Mountains or something and they would meet these people and they all came back feeling like, “Yeah, I’m an American. They’re an American. We’re all Americans here, out here in the woods, and doing this sort of thing.”The parks and the forests promoted that. This idea. These are America’s playgrounds and by that, they mean this is where all Americans can come, all of us. I think that that notion still persist. Just my own experience with camping is that you get out, you get your camp site and people will just come up, chat with you, take a look at your gear, offer you things, be very helpful. I don’t think that has changed a great deal but, it’s definitely something that appears at least in the early 20th century, if not earlier.Brett McKay: Right, so probably by the mid 1920s the car had become a main stay in American culture. How did the car pretty much poor gas on the camping flame in America?Terence Young: The automobile transformed camping. The automobile, initially, was a play thing for the rich. It didn’t have much effect until through 1910, give or take. But then, Henry Ford, to his ever lasting credit, he figured out how to make automobiles cheaply and in mass numbers. People took to cars like crazy and the number of people who could camp skyrocketed.The automobile really made camping available to anybody who could afford a car and there were a lot of used cars in short order. America really took to the road and so, we see the number of people going camping in the national parks just takes off like a rocket by the 1920s certainly. It’s just going up very, very fast. Campers loved this. They didn’t see the car … Many, at least most campers, they didn’t see the car as some sort of inappropriate invasion of the woods or desert or where ever. But rather, they saw it as something that facilitated their ability to get into the wild. That is, if nothing else, it could take them to the edge of some road less area. But, it did allow them to go into such wild places, which for the average person, seemed very wild. So, the automobile had a huge effect. Tremendous effect on camping.Brett McKay: I’m sure the debate between what was real camping only intensified. Bet all the canoe campers were like, “Oh these car campers, they’re ruining the scene here with their cars.”Terence Young: Oh yes! I mean, the automobile probably, indirectly, is responsible for the creation of wilderness in America and the prompting of a lot of backpacking. And as you say, a lot of canoe camping as well. People who were supporting of backpacking and wilderness and canoe areas and protected lake areas and stuff, they say the automobile as an invasion by people who just took advantage of the ability of the car to get anywhere and were just creating roads anywhere. Getting the government to do that. They then, pressed to get wilderness areas protected for backpackers or wilderness areas for canoe campers.So, the automobile, it very much facilitated the number of campers but, in reaction to that, the automobile also ended up creating places for backpacking and canoe camping too.Brett McKay: The automobile, one of the things it did as well, is it pretty much created the infrastructure of camping that we see today. Like, you go to any campsite, whether it’s a state park or national park, you’re going to see pretty much the same thing. You’re going to see a restroom facility. You’re going to see a table, like a cement table, or wooden picnic table with a grill, preset campsites. You’ll see showers and you’ll see the ubiquitous one way road that goes through. This started in about 1930s, right? With EP Meinecke, is that his last name? Tell us a little bit about him.Terence Young: Just before the 1930s, as we said, camping is booming because of the automobile and lots and lots of campers are coming, especially to the national parks and forests in the west. There’s no regulation. The national park service has an approach to regulation, which they refer to as indirect. That is, they don’t like to put up signs. They don’t like to tell you, “You can’t park here. You can’t do this there. You can’t do …”They’d rather put a rock in your way to get you to not park there or something like that. Well, they didn’t want to tell campers, “Don’t camp in places.” So people could camp virtually anywhere in the national park and they did. The problem was, they particularly liked to all camp in the same places, which would be like Stone Men Meadow at Yosemite or something. They liked to be right up against the rivers and this was killing the vegetation, polluting the rivers. Something had to be done about all of this as a result. Then, there’s all these cars crammed together.The forest service approached a gentleman named EP Minecky who worked for the department of agriculture. He was a plant pathologist. And they said, “Can you help?” He’d helped them with other vegetation issues and they said, “Look, the campers are basically killing the redwoods. The giant Sequoia as Sequoia National Park and the around the area. Can you help us?” Minecky went, took a look and said, “Yep, you’re right. All these campers in these cars, they’re killing the trees because they’re running over the roots.” So, they said, “What can we do?” Long story short, Minecky basically developed a design, the modern camp ground.That is, like you were saying, you now have fixed roads. They’re one way. Can’t go in both directions. You have a camping spur for your car. It’s sort of a garage in the forest if you will. There’s a table sitting there. There’s a place where your tent is supposed to go. There’s supposed to be, should be, some vegetation around you.So, sort of what he did was he created a space that mimicked a domestic space, which you had to fill up. Then, there were restrooms that you had to walk to nearby and water fountains, or whatever, spigot. Things like that nearby. This is all Minecky and he did this, basically, in 1932 is when he came up with this design, which as you said, is now just everywhere. Virtually every state national park I’ve ever been to basically uses this same design for their automobile campgrounds.Minecky is the fellow who put that together and one of the peels to this, for the forest service and the park service, was not just that it eliminated pollution and that sort of thing, but also was, the parks were being over run by people. They were being loved to death by campers and the forest but, the administrations didn’t have anyway to sort of manage that. This camp ground gave them a tool. That is, what it did was, as they say it, unitized the campsites. That is, there’s a campsite number one, and when all campsites, all your 38 campsites or 107 or whatever there were, when somebody was in everyone then the authorities could say, “Camp ground’s full. You can’t camp here.” And previously they’d not been able to say it was full. People would just say, “I can cram something in there. I could shove a car in there. It’ll be fine.” This gave them an ability to control the campers so that they could make space.Then, they added the two week rule, or 30 day. Initially a 30 day rule, then a two week rule. You can only stay for 30 days or you can only stay for two weeks and then, you have to leave so somebody else can come in and camp here. It gave the authorities not only better protection of the environment but, it also gave them more control over camp grounds so that people would just come, which they did, and come and camp for three months and basically use up all the space.Brett McKay: Yeah. So, the car democratized camping even more but then, as you talk about in the book, there was sort of a revolt against car camping and this sort of emphasis on canoe camping but also backpacking. But one of the other movements that was going on in America that coincided with this shift was The Long Trail Movement, that started with the Appalachian Trail, then the Pacific Crest Trails. How did the Long Trail Movement sort of put the gas on backpacking in America?Terence Young: People had been hiking, particularly in the northeast and the Appalachians. The Appalachian Mountain Club is an old organization, which had been about hiking. They had cabins and stuff like this along, they still do, along their trails. But in the early 20th century, 1910s, actually the first long distance trail is called the Long Trail in Vermont and this was supported by people who wanted to go out and camp as well as hike and just walk along so they’d have a place to do that. Backpackers, these things are all coming together. Backpackers had become more enthusiastic and they were more active and their equipment, their gear, was getting lighter in the early 20th century and they wanted places for themselves.So, they pushed to create these long trails and as you said, probably the best known of the early ones is the Appalachian Trail, the AT, stretching, whatever it is, 2,000 miles. Then, it was followed, pretty quickly at least, by the idea of – took a little longer to complete – The Pacific Crest Trail. I think that the significance of these trails and the significance of backpacking in popular imagination has always remained strong, in that, this is form of camping, which even those people who don’t want to practice it, I think would admit that, “Yeah, there’s … It’s a special form and provides a special experience because you have to walk, just like people have always had to until 20th century, or whatever.” They finally got cars but people for 10,000 years have had to walk if they wanted to get places. That’s what backpackers do and it has this special appeal.I think we can see that popular significance, even today, in the consequence of Sheryl Straid’s book ‘Wild’, then the movie being made from it. This idea, Sheryl Straid, she went on the Pacific Crest Trail to find herself in that long walk and I’ve heard this from many people who have done seriously long distance backpacking, which I admit, I have not. But, I talked to one gentleman. He walked the AT three times, the entire thing and the last time he did it, at the end he broke down and just started crying and he couldn’t stop because he said doing that kind of long distance walking puts you in a mental state that’s simply not reproducible else where. There’s special places.Brett McKay: I’m curious, I forgot to ask this Terence but, was this whole camping craze, beginning in the 19th century into the middle part of the 20th century, was this a uniquely American thing or were other western countries also experience this sort of camping craze going on?Terence Young: Well, camping is equally popular in Canada, to Americans. It’s more or less contemporary with what’s happening in the United States. I don’t think it’s quite as intense. The forms are practiced elsewhere but the meaning, I think, is really an American Experience. I mean, you can go to France. French are big campers. Or Germany or Sweden, or any of number of places around the world, Australia and stuff. And you’ll find people who are camping but the reason they camp is, like in the case of Europeans in particular, it’s an inexpensive form of vacation. They’ll tell you that. “Why you camping?” “Well, it’s cheap and allows us to be here.”But, I think to say that about American camping, just see it as something that’s inexpensive vacation, misses the cultural significance that it has held for us for a long time. It’s a means for Americans who aren’t comfortable with cities to kind of make up for having to live in them. I mean, we understand if you want to have a job and good income and all that today, you’re going to more or less end up living in a city. But, you don’t have to like it. Camping is a way to kind of make up for it for a couple of weeks, or whatever. That is unusual. That’s something Americans do. More than anybody else.You’d have to ask … If you go to Britain, “Why do they camp?” They have other reasons but not the same as us.Brett McKay: What’s the state of American camping today?Terence Young: It’s still very strong. Latest surveys I’ve read put camping, we’re talking at least, a minimum of 50 million Americans, about 1/6 of the population go camping every year. When you ask people, “What do you do in your leisure time?” You give them a list of things and they’ll pick them. Camping almost invariably ends up in the top 10 and that’s up there with watching television, and going to restaurants and stuff like this. It remains extremely popular in America.At the same time, I would say it is not as significant … Well, the numbers are still enormous. It’s not as culturally significant as it once was. I think the kind of high point in American history for camping, as a kind of cultural phenomenon, was the 1920s. It was that car. I mean, the car liberated people to go camping. Everybody went camping. Henry Ford, John Burrows, Harvey Firestone and Thomas Edison had these annual camping trips that they did and that were in the news and stuff like this. President Harding joined them on a camping trip. It was enormous at that time. But the total number, of course, is much smaller than now.The other thing I would say about camping today is I suspect in part, it’s slowly declining. Not seriously and certainly in backpacking hasn’t declined but, the other forms of camping, the number of people doing them, seems to be in a slow decline but not serious. I would like to think, I mean I’m not sure exactly why, but I would like to think that one of the reasons is that American cities are becoming more comfortable little … There’s a little bit more wildness in American cities and the need to leave the city, to go into some place far away, isn’t quite as necessary anymore.I say this in part because if you look at pictures of American cities in 1920, they are just so bare. Those street trees and are few and just little green anywhere. You compare that now to the efforts that I think we’re trying to do now a days to green up our cities, put in more squares, put in more street trees, just generally make them more comfortable in terms of mix of wild and art, human art. It’s perhaps taken a little bit of the sting out of life in the city and therefore, a little less desire to go camping.Brett McKay: Well, Terence this has been a great conversation. There’s a lot more we could talk about in the book but where can people go to learn more information about the book?Terence Young: Well, I have a Facebook page for the book, as a matter of fact, called Heading Out or Camping in America, I think either one will take you there. But also, the book is published by Cornell University Press and they have a website, CornellPress.Cornell.edu and you can find out everything about it there and it’s for sale in book stores, online, that sort of thing.Brett McKay: Fantastic. Well, Terence Young thank you so much for your time. It’s been a pleasure.Terence Young: Oh, it’s been a real pleasure. Thank you for asking me to be here.Brett McKay: My guest today was Terence Young. He’s the author of the book ‘Heading Out: A History of American Camping’.

      "Faulkner clocked in each day at 6 PM for a 12-hour shift. From 11 PM to 4 AM, while the world was asleep and not in need of much power, there wasn’t much to do around the plant. Amid the hum of machines, using an overturned wheelbarrow as a desk, Faulkner found he could write a whole chapter during this window of time. After his shift was over, he’d come home, eat breakfast, and then sleep for a couple of hours. In the afternoons he continued writing and took naps. Then it was back to the power plant again. By sticking to this schedule, Faulkner managed to finish As I Lay Dying in just 47 days.\n",

A prodigious walker from an early age who never learned to drive, Stevens fit his poetry composition in on his several mile-long strolls to and from work. He found solitude and creativity on these meditative perambulations — the scenes furnishing imagery, his cadence providing rhythm — and when inspiration struck, he’d jot down a line or two on the envelopes he kept stuffed in his pockets.\n",

      "Abraham Lincoln provided himself with an autodidactic education by utilizing every spare moment of his day for self-study. Not only did he read during the mornings and evenings, but he always carried a book with him as he went about his jobs as a store owner, postmaster, and surveyor; as soon as there arose a minute of downtime, he’d crack open the tome and take in a page or two. In this way, he slowly worked through a library of legal texts, became a lawyer, and entered public life.\n",

      "All those I think who have lived as literary men — working daily as literary labourers — will agree with me that three hours a day will produce as much as a man ought to write.

      "****\n",
      "It had at this time become my custom — and is still my custom, though of late I have become a little lenient of myself — to write with my watch before me, and to require of myself 250 words every quarter of an hour. I have found that the 250 words have been forthcoming as regularly as my watch went. But my three hours were not devoted entirely to writing. I always began my task by reading the work of the day before, an operation which would take me half an hour, and which consisted chiefly in weighing with my ear the sound of the words and phrases…\n",
      "****\n",
      "This division of time allowed me to produce over ten pages of an ordinary novel volume a day, and if kept up through ten months, would have given as its results three novels of three volumes each in the year — the precise amount which so greatly acerbated the publisher in Paternoster Row, and which must at any rate be felt to be quite as much as the novel-readers of the world can want from the hands of one man.”\n",

      "This belief has the tendency to turn into something of a self-fulfilling prophecy; having seen a light at the end of the tunnel, the disgruntled employee starts noticing the annoyances of his job even more, has less patience in putting up with them, and comes to increasingly resent his 9-5.\n",

      "John Stuart Mill, who many know as a philosopher and political economist, actually spent most of his adult life gainfully employed as a civil servant. When he was 17, his father got him an administrative job at the East India Company (which functioned like the State Department for the British colonies in India), and he remained there for 35 years, until the company was abolished.

He also felt that doing something different for a shift each day refreshed him to get back to his philosophical writing. Finally, in his autobiography, he describes an additional benefit: independence and freedom from the pressure to churn out books and articles aimed at making money and appealing to the masses:\n",

      "“I do not know any one of the occupations by which a subsistence can now be gained, more suitable than such as this to anyone who, not being in independent circumstances, desires to devote a part of the twenty-four hours to private intellectual pursuits. Writing for the press cannot be recommended as a permanent resource to anyone qualified to accomplish anything in the higher departments of literature or thought: not only on account of the uncertainty of this means of livelihood, especially if the writer has a conscience, and will not consent to serve any opinions except his own; but also because the writings by which one can live, are not the writings which themselves live, and are never those in which the writer does his best.\n",
      "****\n",
      "Books destined to form future thinkers take too much time to write, and when written come, in general, too slowly into notice and repute, to be relied on for subsistence. Those who have to support themselves by their pen must depend on literary drudgery, or at best on writings addressed to the multitude; and can employ in the pursuits of their own choice, only such time as they can spare from those of necessity; which is generally less than the leisure allowed by office occupations, while the effect on the mind is far more enervating and fatiguing.”\n",

      "In other words, if you make writing your full-time job, you’ll often have to spend the bulk of your energy doing mentally draining, superficial hackwork, instead of the things you really think are important.

      "After trying unsuccessfully to cobble together an income from freelance reviewing, editing, and lecturing, T.S. Eliot took a position at Lloyds Bank in London. His more bohemian literary friends were perplexed by this move, and shook their heads at the sight of such a creative poet decked out in a conservative 3-piece suit and bowler hat, swinging an umbrella, headed off to work 8-14 hour days tabulating balance sheets. But like Mill, Eliot found that his bank job helped unleash, rather than stifle, his creativity.\n",
      "****\n",
      "Before working for the bank, the anxiety caused by his financial straits had been so great as to paralyze his writing altogether. Once he had a steady income coming in, and was freed from having to write just to make ends meet, he entered one of the most fruitful periods of his career, which included penning The Waste Land.\n",
      "****\n",
      "Eliot found that the structure and stability of his job gave him greater discipline and self-respect, as well as grist for his prose. Like Trollope, he found it easier to criticize civilization while being right in the belly of the beast; he referred to his bank job as “Sojourning among the termites.” Also like Trollope, he thought a writer could do no more than 3 hours of good work a day, and thus saw little reason in not working.\n",

      "After failing to find a teaching post upon graduation from Zurich Polytechnic, and spending two years living hand-to-mouth as a private tutor, Albert Einstein famously went to work as a clerk at the Federal Patent Office in Bern, Switzerland. While some have erroneously believed he merely bided his time there until he could become a full-fledged scientist, the years he spent as a patent examiner helped set the stage for the rest of his illustrious career.\n",
      "****\n",
      "The job wasn’t overly demanding and left Einstein time to work on his own scientific research after his shift (and sometimes during it — legend has it he called the drawer in his desk at work where he stashed his personal notes “the department of theoretical physics”). So too, his newfound financial stability was experienced as a welcome change. “I am doing well,” he wrote a friend. “I am an honorable federal ink pisser with a regular salary. Besides I ride my old mathematico-physical hobbyhorse and saw on my violin.” He even recommended that a friend come work at the same office, advising him to keep in mind that “Besides the eight hours of work, each day also has eight hours for mischief, and then there’s Sunday.”\n",
      "****\n",
      "Indeed, having a 9-5 at this time in Einstein’s life suited him fine; he was glad to have his independence apart from the publish-or-perish pressures that came with being attached to a university. “A practical profession is a salvation for a man of my type,” he mused. “An academic career compels a young man to scientific production, and only strong character can resist the temptation of superficial analysis.”\n",
      "****\n",
      "“Free from everyday worries to produce my best creative work,” Einstein in fact experienced an absolute intellectual flourishing during his tenure at the patent office. He completed a dissertation, earned his PhD from the University of Zurich, and published 32 papers, including 4 positively groundbreaking treatises in 1905 — which has been termed his annus mirabilis (miracle year) — alone.\n",
      "****\n",
      "Independence and income weren’t the only things about Einstein’s day job that helped propel his future career. While examining patents might not seem directly related to theories on light and space and time, his responsibility for reviewing applications related to electromagnetic devices did add fuel — some additional mental models — to the furnace of his mind, and led to his conducting new kinds of experiments.\n",
      "****\n",
      "Further, the very nature of the job sharpened his thinking; he had to utilize his visual imagination in conceptualizing how the proposed inventions would work, grasp the premises behind their mechanisms, and analyze drawings that were submitted as part of the application. He was also tasked with rewording the inventor’s description of their device, and re-formulating it in the clearest possible language. Above all, his supervisor impressed upon him the necessity of thinking critically — of not getting sucked into the inventor’s own (and possibly flawed) conclusions and rationales. In the end, Einstein said, the experience of being a patent examiner trained him to think clearly and logically — skills that would reap dividends for the rest of his life.\n",
      "****\n",
      "Einstein ultimately felt he did need more time to fully pursue his theories and left the patent office in 1909 to become an associate professor. Still, for the rest of his life he was grateful for his experience as a 9-5er and waxed nostalgic about his stint working as a patent examiner. “In this worldly cloister,” he remembered of his old office days, “I hatched my most beautiful thoughts.”\n",

      "Many folks feel like their day job is an impediment to allowing their side hustles to blossom, and wish they could pursue what they feel to be their true vocation with complete single-mindedness. But what the above men (and plenty more examples could be furnished) show, is that having a full-time job can actually be quite advantageous in getting your dream off the ground — if you have the right attitude about it.\n",
      "****\n",
      "You’ll hear plenty of people say you should just quit your current job if you want to make it in another field — the reasoning being that the resulting pressure will force you to either sink or swim. And yet history shows that sometimes the very opposite is true: having a safety net can liberate you to do your very best and most creative work.\n",
      "****\n",
      "Plus, the skills and perspective you gain by working a regular job can carry over in unexpected ways and indirectly enhance your ability to perform your side hustle. Even the annoyances of a day job can be used as fodder for your artistic efforts!\n",
      "****\n",
      "That being said, the day job you choose does matter. It should be stimulating enough not to bore you, and yet undemanding enough not to sap the energies you’ll need for your “second shift.” Before Eliot’s banking gig, for example, he had tried working as a high school teacher, but found that “performing” in front of students each day left him feeling too tired to write in the evenings, or even on holiday breaks. Mill described the needed balance in a creative professional’s day job this way: “sufficiently intellectual not to be a distasteful drudgery, without being such as to cause any strain upon the mental powers of a person used to abstract thought.”\n",

      "In many a new moonlighter’s mind, they see an adequate source of income from their side hustle accruing in just a few months, and imagine themselves turning in their resignation at their office job before the new year arrives.\n",
      "****\n",
      "Not only is this expectation unreasonable in the vast majority of cases, it’s also frequently unwise.\n",
      "****\n",
      "If you go into a moonlighting endeavor with an instant gratification mindset, you’ll invariably end up quitting prematurely once immediate results are not forthcoming, and you realize just how much work and time success is going to involve. Plus, hanging on to your day job for not just a year, but maybe several, is likely going to be essential to eventually being able to switch to your side business full-time.\n",
      "****\n",
      "It took George Eastman, the founder of Kodak, 4 years from the time he began tinkering with and learning about the art and mechanics of photography to the day he finally quit his job as a bank clerk.\n",
      "****\n",
      "Eastman had originally gotten into taking pictures as a hobby, but quickly realized there was great commercial potential in figuring out ways to simplify what was then a bulky, messy, time-consuming process. The 23-year-old taught himself all the ins and outs of the field by studying journals, talking with local photographers, and reading chemistry manuals, then focused his efforts on improving the plates used in cameras.\n",
      "****\n",
      "At the time, “wet” plates were used, which had to be coated by hand with an emulsion and sensitized with nitrate of silver right before exposure. For two years, Eastman experimented in the laboratory he had created inside his mother’s boarding house where he lived, seeking to develop “dry” plates that were pre-coated with an emulsion, as well as a machine which could apply the coating manually, evenly, and cheaply.\n",
      "****\n",
      "Eastman patented the resulting inventions, and began to sell the rights to manufacture them to companies in Europe. All the while, he kept his job working 6 days a week as an assistant bookkeeper at the Rochester Savings Bank. The position provided a fairly handsome salary, and helped fund Eastman’s after-hours experiments. On weekdays, he’d work on his growing photography business from when he got off from the bank in the afternoon until morning the next day; his mother would often wake to find her son asleep on the floor. On the weekends, he would catch up on his sleep, and then begin his punishing schedule again on Monday.\n",
      "****\n",
      "When Eastman began manufacturing his own photographic devices, he rented a small loft above a music store two blocks from the bank. After his shift crunching numbers, he’d bike to his “factory,” put on his side hustle hat, and work through the night, stopping only for catnaps taken in a hammock he had designed himself and slung up in the corner.\n",
      "****\n",
      "Eastman initially took care of all the engineering, marketing, and bookkeeping for the business himself. He tested the market for his inventions by personally selling them to local photographers and getting their feedback. But as his business started to take off, he began to bring on more employees and moved into a larger facility.\n",
      "****\n",
      "Then, after the 27-year-old inventor and entrepreneur had spent 4 years tinkering and testing in his spare time, he formed the Eastman Dry Plate Company, and finally hung up his hat as a banker.\n",

      "The founder of Nike made an even slower and more protracted transition from bean counter to CEO.\n",
      "****\n",
      "Phil Knight had gotten the idea of selling Japanese running shoes in the U.S. while earning his MBA from Stanford, and on a post-graduation trip round the world, he stopped in Japan to put the gears of that dream in motion. Knight met with the manufacturer of Tiger-brand shoes, which he admired, and managed to secure the rights to distribute them back in the States. The manufacturer promised to ship Knight samples of the sneakers soon.\n",
      "****\n",
      "The Tigers ended up taking over a year to arrive. In the meantime, Knight enrolled in classes needed to get his CPA and took a job with the accounting firm Lybrand, Ross Bros. & Montgomery. When the shoes finally showed up, he used them to convince the University of Oregon’s track coach (who Knight had run for during his undergrad days) to partner with him, and together they formed Blue Ribbon Sports (the company that would become Nike) in 1964.\n",
      "****\n",
      "A now 26-year-old Knight got 300 more pairs of Tiger shoes shipped to him and stacked them up in the basement of his parents’ home, where he still lived. Feeling ready to make a go at being a full-time running shoe entrepreneur, he promptly quit his accounting job, loaded his sneakers in the trunk of his Plymouth Valiant, and drove all over the Pacific Northwest, showing up to track meets and talking to coaches and runners about why they needed to try Tigers.\n",
      "****\n",
      "The shoes caught on quickly. People were writing, calling, and even showing up at the door of the Knight home asking to buy a pair. Knight hired a salesman to expand his market and pitch Tigers to runners in California.\n",
      "****\n",
      "But by late 1965, Blue Ribbon Sports was in trouble. Sales were strong, but the company was also frequently in debt. With the balance sheet hovering around zero, Knight had to take out a loan each time he ordered another shipment of shoes, but his bank, which thought he was too much of a credit risk, wouldn’t extend him the needed funding.\n",
      "****\n",
      "Seeking a plan B in case Blue Ribbon went belly up, as well as another source of funding, Knight took his CPA exam, and accepted a job as an accountant at Price Waterhouse. Even though he was back to having a corporate day job, he largely didn’t mind, as he was able to invest a significant portion of his paychecks into Blue Ribbon, “padding my previous equity, [and] boosting the company’s cash balance.”\n",
      "****\n",
      "In addition to often working 6 days a week as an accountant, Knight, who had served one year of active service in the Army before joining the Reserves, also had to spend 14 hours a month doing military training. Yet these significant time constraints didn’t stymy Knight’s drive; on weekends, nights, and “vacations” he continued to expand Blue Ribbon’s footprint.\n",
      "****\n",
      "In 1966, he moved into a one-room apartment, and lined the place wall-to-wall with his entire inventory of shoes. A year later, having quickly outgrown these cramped quarters, he moved the business into a larger one-room commercial space which consisted of a retail/office area up front, and a “warehouse” in the back (the areas were separated by a jerry-rigged wall of plywood).\n",
      "****\n",
      "By 1967, Knight was managing 4 employees, two retail stores, and an office on both the West and East coasts.\n",
      "****\n",
      "And he was still working as accountant.\n",
      "****\n",
      "It’s not that Knight didn’t greatly desire to quit his day job in order to concentrate solely on his burgeoning sneaker business; as he relates in his autobiography on the early years of Nike, it just took years for that to become a viable option:\n",
      "****\n",
      "“I wanted to dedicate every minute of every day to Blue Ribbon. I’d never been a multitasker, and I didn’t see any reason to start now. I wanted to be present, always. I wanted to focus constantly on the one task that really mattered. If my life was to be all work and no play, I wanted my work to be play. I wanted to quit Price Waterhouse. Not that I hated it; it just wasn’t me.\n",
      "****\n",
      "I wanted what everyone wants. To be me, full-time.\n",
      "****\n",
      "But it wasn’t possible. Blue Ribbon simply couldn’t support me. Though the company was on track to double sales for a fifth straight year, it still couldn’t justify a salary for its cofounder.”\n",
      "****\n",
      "While Knight couldn’t get by without a day job, he did come up with a compromise for himself in 1968 — taking a job that still paid the bills, but offered more flexibility: teaching classes at Portland State University. As an assistant professor, he “still didn’t have all the time I wanted or needed for Blue Ribbon but I had more.”\n",
      "****\n",
      "Finally, in 1969, 7 years after first ordering a sample of Tiger shoes, and just shy of his 31st birthday, Knight quit teaching, and drew his first salary from Blue Ribbon.\n",

      "Now I don’t consider myself a famous man, or equal to the ranks of the other gents we’ve talked about. But allow me to mention the time it frequently takes to make a full-time living on a blog, as it’s commonly quite underestimated.\n",

      "With blogging and online media/commerce, people often think the old rules don’t apply and that you can become an overnight success. Perhaps that happens for some folks, but that wasn’t the case with my creating the Art of Manliness.\n",

      "I started AoM in January of 2008 when I was in law school and working a part-time job. I’d work and study at school from 8 am to 8 pm each weekday, and then work on the site for a few hours in the evenings and the weekends. Kate supported us by teaching at a community college.\n",
      "****\n",
      "When I graduated in 2009, we were barely making enough revenue from AoM to scrape by so I took a corporate job working for a legal research company.\n",
      "****\n",
      "It wasn’t until December 2010, 3 years after I started the Art of Manliness, that I was able to make it my full-time gig. I think moonlighting during those years truly worked to my advantage. I was able to use the modest revenue generated by the site to pay off Kate and my student loans, so that I had greater financial stability when I made the jump. I got plenty of time to figure out whether blogging or working in the legal field was what I ultimately wanted to do. And I got better at being the editor-in-chief of a magazine and was able to make and learn from mistakes without the pressure of relying on the site for my livelihood.\n",
      "****\n",
      "That AoM (hopefully) comes off as a site with a lot of integrity, is partly due to the fact that while setting its course, I didn’t have to compromise my principles in order to try to maximize its profits to keep a roof over my head.\n",
      "****\n",
      "Even though you might be tempted to, you don’t necessarily need to quit your day job as soon as you get an idea for a side business. In fact, in can be beneficial to take things slow and build up your biz step-by-step, before making the leap.\n",
      "****\n",
      "Keeping your eggs in two baskets until the moonlighting embryos hatch, gives you the financial independence to make the best possible decisions, allows you to experiment, refine your ideas, and test the market for your product, provides access to a steady source of equity, and helps set the stage for a successful launch of your business.\n",

      "****\n",
      "“I initially used the image of the barbell to describe a dual attitude of playing it safe in some areas…and taking a lot of small risks in others…hence achieving antifragility. That is extreme risk aversion on one side and extreme risk loving on the other…For antifragility is the combination aggressiveness plus paranoia—clip your downside, protect yourself from extreme harm, and let the upside…take care of itself.”\n",
      "****\n",
      "By moonlighting while keeping your day job, you minimize the downsides of your side business failing, while opening up the opportunity for it to take off into something great.\n",
      "****\n",
      "It’s a strategy that gives you optionality.\n",
      "****\n",
      "So play the long game with your side hustle; don’t feel anxious about aiming for slow and steady progress. Measure you expectations in years, rather than months. There may come a point where, like stretching out Silly Putty, you reach a breaking point and have to choose to go full-time with either your day job or side business. But the string can be stretched out a lot longer than many think, and it’s likely in your interest to keep on pulling as long as you can.\n",

      "Yet when Einstein was working for the patent office, he went home to a small apartment and a new wife and baby boy. A biographer describes the abode as having “many distractions…Wet clothes were strung across the kitchen drying…the room smelled of diapers and stale smoke, and puffs of smoke arose every so often from the stove.” But “these things didn’t seem to bother Einstein. He had the baby on one knee and a pad on the other, and every so often he would write an equation on the pad, then quickly rock the baby a little faster as he began to fuss.”\n",

      "When Stephen King wrote his first novel, Carrie, he and his wife, who were parents to a toddler and a newborn, were just barely getting by and were living in a double-wide trailer. His wife Tabby watched the kids while he taught English at a private school, and then she went to work the second shift at Dunkin Donuts. In the summers he made extra money working as a janitor, gas station attendant, and in an industrial laundry facility.\n",
      "****\n",
      "King did his writing in the evenings, working on a makeshift desk Tabby had found room for by wedging it between the washing machine and the dryer. He hammered out his stories on a typewriter as Tabby made dinner, and his kids cried and toddled around.\n",
      "****\n",
      "So kids and an unfavorable working environment just plain don’t cut the mustard as reasons you can’t moonlight. If you wait for the perfect conditions to get started on your side project, you’ll wait forever.\n",
      "****\n",
      "But maybe it still seems just too plain hard. You’re tired after your day job, and don’t you deserve to relax and have some fun?\n",
      "****\n",
      "Well, it just depends on what you consider enjoyable, and how much satisfaction you’re really getting from your current pastimes. Working on your side hustle just might become your favorite part of the day.\n",

He wrote Catch-22 by putting in 2-3 hours each night on it for eight years. At one point, he decided to give himself a break and just spend his evenings watching television with his wife instead. But as he recalled, this kind of vegged-out relaxation didn’t suit him: “Television drove me back to Catch-22. I couldn’t imagine what Americans did at night when they weren’t writing novels.”\n",
      "****\n",
      "Of the time Phil Knight spent juggling his job at Price Waterhouse, Army Reserve training, and growing Blue Ribbon, he remembers having “No friends, no exercise, no social life.” And yet he felt “wholly content. My life was out of balance, sure, but I didn’t care. In fact, I wanted even more imbalance.”\n",
      "****\n",
      "A moonlighter who successfully fights through the common excuses, and starts and sticks with his side project, frequently finds that though the extra work makes him far busier than working a day job alone, the extra endeavor enhances rather than impoverishes his life. He has a “secret” mission to work on, plans to scheme, and an interest and purpose to dream about outside the TPS reports done in his cubicle each day. If his 9-5 is just so-so, and not wholly fulfilling, he has something else to get up early or stay up late for — a labor that just might turn out to be his real life’s work.\n",

      "Brett McKay: So, you wrote a history of one of my all time favorite activities, camping. And really, after reading this book, I’m looking at camping now with completely new eyes. I’m looking at campsites differently, because I know why campsites look the way they do and why there’s the one way loop and all that thing. But, what I found most interesting about this book was that, for some reason, I always thought of camping as sort of this er recreational activity, right? This sort of thing that humans have always done for fun for a long time but, then, when you think about it it’s like, “That doesn’t make any sense.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So, you point out in the book that camping for the sake of camping is actually a relatively new concept. So, when did camping become just an activity that people just did for the sake of doing it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: Well, as you say Brett, camping is, in a sense, is ancient. Probably as long as there have been people, people have camped but, they didn’t camp for fun. They camped because they had to. The idea of camping, actually the word comes from the military word ‘campaign’, to engage in a campaign and they had to set up encampments and so, there were camps. Like, camp Lagune or things like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Camping as a recreational activity, in some ways, initially came along, at least in America, with hunting and fishing but, hunters and fishers would go out to do that, hunt and fish. But, they had to camp as a kind of adjunct to hunting and fishing. It’s only after the US Civil War ended in 1865 that we start to see people going camping just to camp, that they might hunt and fish. There were still many people still going hunting and fishing and then had to camp. But, this is when they first see the appearance of the idea, that camping itself is a form of recreation.\n",

      "Brett McKay: So, I’m curious. I mean, what was it about coast velum America, the cultural melou of it that made people start camping just for camping sake?\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: The northern part of the country boomed. The economy boomed and industry was growing and the cities like, New York, Boston, Hartford, Philadelphia, they were growing very rapidly in population and getting much larger. Along with this industrialization and urbanization of America came a lot of regulation, a lot of pollution, noise, smoke, things like this. A lot of crowding, a lot of strangers that people didn’t know.\n",

There had been cities like New York before the Civil War but they largely had been relatively small and the vast majority of Americans had lived in small towns and on farms and tiny settlements and stuff. And this new experience caused a sort of, I would say, identity crisis, if you will, amongst people who weren’t sure. Who am I, in a way, and is this still America?\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the things, amongst many, that they turned to was camping. Camping going back with this kind of romantic idea of nature as relief, as whatever solution, anidine to their sense of like, “Am I really in the right place being here in the city?” They didn’t want to leave the city because that’s where the jobs were, that’s where the money was. But, they wanted some relief from the city and camping seemed to fill the bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: Right, so in a way it was an anti modern revolt? In a sort of-\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: But yeah, you said this was among other things. This was sort of … Besides camping, I know during this same period, people got really into arts and crafts. This is like when the arts and crafts movement started in Europe and America and people were all about “I’m going to build things with my hands and rustic things are great things because it’s not tainted by urbanization or technology.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, that’s right and we do … One of the reasons the arts and crafts movement rose was because people were increasingly in jobs where they didn’t make anything from beginning to end, right? They, whatever, made a part that was assembled into something larger and so, they didn’t necessarily see a completion to their actions. They came enamored of this idea of doing things themselves, and having control and finishing something. Camping is a part of that whole larger movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: Right. One of the individuals, most influential individuals in sort of kick starting the camping movement in America, never heard of this guy but he’s a pretty interesting character. His name is William HH Murray. What was it about his book that he wrote? It’s called ‘Adventures in the Wilderness’, that helped kickstart the camping craze?\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: Well, Murray, for a little background on him. Murray was a congregationalist minister from Boston. He was actually the head of the Park Street Church, which is probably the most significant, or was the most significant, congregational church in America. He was a graduate of Yale. He was very educated gentleman. He was a very enthusiastic outdoors man. He especially loved canoeing and, the thing about his book, his book is, I think, kicks off camping for a number of reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "One, it’s accessible, it’s still in print. It’s well written. He’s funny. He’s sort of self reflectively funny. But most importantly, unlike anybody before him, he basically came right out and flatly said, “Well, how do you camp?” He told people how to do it. Writers before him hadn’t really said that. They just assumed everyone knew how. Of course, most urban people in 1869, when ‘Adventures in the Wilderness’ was published, most urban people they didn’t have any idea about how to go camping into the wild. They lived in the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "His book told them how. You needed to go here, do that. He told them where to go into the Adirondacks in particular. And he told them why. I think that why was also very important because what he did was, he addressed the anxieties that urban people in the post Civil War era were feeling. He came right out and said, “Yes, the reason you don’t feel good is, you work in an office, it’s crowded, your boss is a pain.” These sorts of things and he was the first one to come right out and say it and he was a minister saying this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it gave him a lot of clout, you know? It’s a combination of a well written book, useful book, informative book, and one that explained why you’d want to go camping. People took him at his word and immediately took off and started camping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: How much of an impact did this book have? Like, how many people started camping because of him and how did it change he Adirondacks and the economy there, and just the amount of people there?\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: It’s hard to say exactly how many people were effected directly by Murray’s book but, we know that he made a fortune on the book. He made $25,000 in the first year off sales of the book. This is at a time when the average, or per capita income in the US, is under $200 a year. So, he made an enormous amount of money, so then we know lots of copies were sold. In the Adirondacks, they directly felt it in the year prior to his book coming out. A couple of hundred people showed up as Sandarac Lack during the whole season to go into the back woods and stuff. The year that Murray’s book is written, 1869 that it’s published, they got at least two to 3,000 people. So, they had a 10 to 15 time increase in the number of people camping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the following year, 1870, there was at least 5,000 people or more show up. So, this is a tremendous increase in the number of people going to the Adirondacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: What was camping like at this time? I mean, who were the type of people going and how did they get there and what kind of stuff did they bring for them to camp?\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: Well, relatively few people actually go camping, compared to the total size of the population in the 19th century. This is for a bunch of reasons but particularly it’s mostly upper middle class people who can go camping. That’s largely because you had to have a lot of money, it’s not cheap to go camping in 1880 say, and you needed time. Most Americans didn’t have vacations in the 19th century, most working Americans. So, you had to have your own business or profession, or be able to sell or save enough money to be able to do this so, class people and a few wealthy people that are going.\n",
      "\n",
      "They didn’t take much gear. There wasn’t much gear that we would … The kind of things that we would think of today, just most of them didn’t exist in the 19th century. So, what they would take was relatively heavy and cumbersome and difficult to move around, which means there were not a lot of people who walked as campers, like backpacking, just handful of them. There’s a fair number of people who went on horseback or in canoes, things like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, a few who would go with a horse and wagon, but horse and wagon was very expensive and you had to sort of get a bunch of people together to do it. When they went camping, mostly, they went nearby. They would, just say, take the train two stops past the edge of town, get off, walk out along some river and into the edge of a farm field and plop down and start camping. They were perfectly happy to just go, basically, near by. Only the wealthy, I mean and the truly wealthy, could go long distance to some place like Yellow Stone or Yosemite or something like that. Since most of the people who are camping at this time, in the 19th century, course live in the north eastern part of the US, and Yellow Stone is a long way away. So, you had to have a lot of time and money to do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: Yeah, and during this time, after Murray’s book, this whole marketplace for camping literature just sprung up. Articles started proliferating in magazines about camping. I know you said they talked about the benefits, as it’s a way to recoup from the stressful like of the city but, even though this was primarily an upper middle class activity, one of the benefits that these publishers pushed, or these writers pushed, was that camping was economical. It was like an economic recreational activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: Yes. I mean, it is a common troupe here because I’m sure people were cautious. Somebody would say, “You should go camping for two weeks or a month.” And they’re going, “Yeah, but that’s extra costs.” So, there was many, as you point out, there were many articles that were published saying, “Oh no, no. It’s so inexpensive to go camping that, in fact, you can keep your house and go camping and your overall expenses will be reduced or, at least, no higher than what you’re already experiencing because you can catch your food. You can go out and catch fish, you don’t have to buy meat.” Something like this. You don’t need to buy fuel, you can just get the fuel from the forest, or something along those lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, yeah, there was a lot of effort to sort of condense people to don’t worry. This is not going to cost you a great deal of money. Also, it’s in the light of people who, of this class, who one of the things they would typically do on vacations, if they had the time and money, was they would go to hotels. Say, in Saratoga or something like this, and that’s very expensive to do, to have a room for two weeks and eat at one of these places. So, camping, people who promoted camping, were situating it in this sort of like, “Yeah, you can do all those things but, you do this, you’ll have a better time and it won’t cost you so much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: You just said they just kind of plop their tent wherever. So, at this time, there still wasn’t an infrastructure for camping. Did conservationist … Because this is when the conversation movement was starting to pick up. Was they considered about the effect that campers were having on the environment and on forest because of their sort of indiscriminate camping?\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: Generally speaking, no. I’ve come across very little in the kind of like, “Be careful” or anything like that. Or, “Gosh, we have to control the campers.” Although, having said that, there are people who do note that there’s problems from this. The forest service, when it first gets money, the US Forest Service, when it first gets money to develop camping facilities it does so as an effort to prevent fires. Or, the park service, and one of the things the park service did, the rangers did, most commonly at first was give people tickets for leaving fires unattended. Fire was a particularly special concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "John Mouer, again as unsurprisingly, one of the things he noted in the late 19th century was that campers were polluting streams. He was one of the first people to sort of mention it and he, in fact, used it as part of his campaign against Hechthechie and Yosemite Park. But, generally speaking, conservationist didn’t seem much concerned with the impacts of campers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: Yeah, they might have probably liked it because it got people in nature and maybe helped promote the cause a bit. Like, “Oh, this is nice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: How did the market respond to America’s camping craze because whenever there’s a craze in America there’s always a company out there trying to capitalize on that. So, what sort of businesses popped up during this time that catered to campers?\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: Well, I think you can sort of put them into three kinds of groups. One is, there were lots of small companies popped up to provide all sorts of items, whether those were, say imagine if you will, before there’s much camping equipment people had to mostly bring plates that would be ceramic or, they would bring cookware that didn’t fit into each other and stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, initially companies sprang up to sort of say, “Okay look, we can sell you cutlery that fits inside your cups, which can be stacked together and all of these pots and pans, they can all be nested together.” They basically … These companies tried to provide greater convince and comfort and they made all sorts of things, all kinds of efforts at cooling, ice chest, there’s ice chest in the 19th century. Cookware in particular is one of the things that people go after. Clothing manufacturers are trying to provide. Tents.\n",
      "\n",
      "But most of these companies, they made a product and then they pretty much disappeared. They didn’t last very long for whatever variety of reasons. In addition to them, there were businesses which recognize … Which already had a product and then, recognized that their product had a new market, potential for a new market, that was campers. So, for instance, Ivory Soap, which was the company that initially made Ivory Soap begins in 1840, long before camping and they’re selling soap to people in homes and stuff like that. But then, in the mid to late 19th century, campers come up and Ivory starts promoting its product to campers. It’s clean, it can clean anything, it floats, you’re not going to lose the bar of soap if you start washing in the stream. There’s a variety of these kinds of companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eagle Brand condensed milk is another one that again and again they say, “We have a product. Let’s market it to campers too.” And a lot of these, you can still … If you go into camping supply store or sporting good stores, you still find products made by companies that generally you don’t think of as camping companies but they make a product that fits camping and gets sold in a sporting goods store.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, lastly, there are those businesses which sprang up and continue and lasted. They sprang up to make a product for campers and they’ve lasted all the way through. The one I always think of and remember most is Air Stream Trailers, say. Now, they’re the beginning of the 20th century but, Air Stream was one of many trailer companies, most of which failed ultimately, but there they are still putting out Air Streams and people still loved them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, I mean, after about 1880, there’s a real awareness that camping is a market, that there’s a big market of campers and you don’t want to pass them up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: Yeah, but what this … The market introduce all these comforts, they introduce this debate that we still see amongst campers, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: About what is real camping. Like, backpackers will say, “Well no, we’re the legit campers because we just take everything we need in. Don’t bring anything out.” The car campers think, “Well we’re better than the trailer campers because at least we’re sleeping in a tent.” Did this debate exist back then, in the early days of camping?\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: Oh yes. Right from the very beginning. I think if we recognize, or we accept the idea, that camping is a sort of anti modern activity and that part of the modern world is technologies. One of the reasons I think campers divide along these different mode, lines of modes, backpacking, trailer camping, canoe camping, car camping. I think one of the reasons they do that is, they are willing to accept different levels of technological presence in nature with them. That tension has never ended.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, totally. I mean, I feel it myself. I love to go camping and I’m sure I’ve made more than one observation that, “Well I would never use that kind of equipment” or something. But, camping is … Sort of, camping is what campers do. You know, if they’re happy with it and they feel good about it and it satisfies them, I think we have to accept that it is camping. Might not be the kind of camping that I or somebody else would care to practice and maybe I wouldn’t feel the pleasure and the relief and release from camping in somebody else’s mode with a trailer, with a backpack, or whatever. Never the less, I think it’s clear that the people who do use those kinds of technologies, they are enjoying themselves. They are having a good time. It does work for them. But, it doesn’t make them anymore satisfied with the other kinds of camping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: Right, now there’s a lot of ritual around camping, even today, right? First thing you do get to a spot, you pitch your tent. Then, you get the fire going. Then, maybe you have a chuck box, you get that going. Were these rituals started back in the 19th century when camping was first getting going?\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: In the 19th century, there’s not so much of that. But, in the 20th century, at the very beginning, late end of the 19th, very beginning the 20th century, it starts to appear. You start to see it in magazines and in how to books, and stuff like this because you start to see articles appearing in, say, winter time in a magazine. Lady’s Home Journal or something like this, Popular Mechanics or something, talking about well now summer is coming. You want to get ready for that camping trip. You got to start planning it. You got to start thinking about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we see this, and this is not exclusive to camping, I think. But at the beginning of the 20th, end of the 19th century they start to … There’s this literature that says imagination is the first thing you do, is image where you’re going to go. Then, you plan it. Then assemble it all and finally, when you’re going to go and get out there. But, the one activity that I think has become most identified, I think with camping, one of those rituals, which does go right back to the very beginning is a camp fire. I mean, you can see people talking about “Be sure to have a camp fire.” Right in the 1870s, right after Murray’s book and virtually every first early books written about camping. They’ll illustrate them with camp fires, people standing around camp fires. It’s clearly something that has a strong ritual meaning for campers, no matter what kind of mode they practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: Yeah. That was interesting too, you bring up this point, by the early 20th century the frontier in America pretty much closed. All the states that were once territories were states. I live in Oklahoma. 1907 Oklahoma was a state. Few years later, Arizona was a state. So, there’s this closing of the frontier. How did that closing of the frontier effect how Americans viewed camping?\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: Well, this idea, which was made, whatever, widely known by Fredrick Jackson Turner, the historian, 1890s. When people came to think of the frontier as closing it wasn’t until it was going away that they came to think “This is how we became Americans.” The frontier was the place where immigrants from other countries, other parts of the world, other parts of America, they’d move out on to the frontier and even if they weren’t true Americans in a way, the interaction between them and the frontier left Americans behind. That it created Americans. So, it was people interacting with the American frontier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, when it is officially declared gone and closed, camping becomes much more of a … It starts to be presented in literature as, “Look, this is how you got to get to the frontier. This is all that’s left. We don’t have that actual frontier anymore but we do have wild places.” What do you do? You go camping. It’s the closest thing we’re going to be able to do. Importantly, you take your children to go camping too because this is how you can be sure that they’ll get that experience that your forebears, that the pioneers, had. They’ll have that same experience and they’ll end up being rugged and tough and self supporting and this sort of thing. So, camping sort of got kicked up a notch culturally, by this idea that the frontier was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: Right, and another idea of the frontier thesis was that the frontier is what made democracy work in America, right? Because the frontier, you could go out and everyone was pretty much the same, whether you were a banker from east or some rough neck or cowboy, you were sort of on the level because you were out facing nature with each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: Yes. This is, again, a common sort of recognition on the part of individual campers. You can find it in their diaries talking about meeting people of all sorts of walks of life and being really pleased and getting along with them. They could go camp in Yellow Stone or Yosemite or Great Smoky Mountains or something and they would meet these people and they all came back feeling like, “Yeah, I’m an American. They’re an American. We’re all Americans here, out here in the woods, and doing this sort of thing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The parks and the forests promoted that. This idea. These are America’s playgrounds and by that, they mean this is where all Americans can come, all of us. I think that that notion still persist. Just my own experience with camping is that you get out, you get your camp site and people will just come up, chat with you, take a look at your gear, offer you things, be very helpful. I don’t think that has changed a great deal but, it’s definitely something that appears at least in the early 20th century, if not earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: Right, so probably by the mid 1920s the car had become a main stay in American culture. How did the car pretty much poor gas on the camping flame in America?\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: The automobile transformed camping. The automobile, initially, was a play thing for the rich. It didn’t have much effect until through 1910, give or take. But then, Henry Ford, to his ever lasting credit, he figured out how to make automobiles cheaply and in mass numbers. People took to cars like crazy and the number of people who could camp skyrocketed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The automobile really made camping available to anybody who could afford a car and there were a lot of used cars in short order. America really took to the road and so, we see the number of people going camping in the national parks just takes off like a rocket by the 1920s certainly. It’s just going up very, very fast. Campers loved this. They didn’t see the car … Many, at least most campers, they didn’t see the car as some sort of inappropriate invasion of the woods or desert or where ever. But rather, they saw it as something that facilitated their ability to get into the wild. That is, if nothing else, it could take them to the edge of some road less area. But, it did allow them to go into such wild places, which for the average person, seemed very wild. So, the automobile had a huge effect. Tremendous effect on camping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: I’m sure the debate between what was real camping only intensified. Bet all the canoe campers were like, “Oh these car campers, they’re ruining the scene here with their cars.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: Oh yes! I mean, the automobile probably, indirectly, is responsible for the creation of wilderness in America and the prompting of a lot of backpacking. And as you say, a lot of canoe camping as well. People who were supporting of backpacking and wilderness and canoe areas and protected lake areas and stuff, they say the automobile as an invasion by people who just took advantage of the ability of the car to get anywhere and were just creating roads anywhere. Getting the government to do that. They then, pressed to get wilderness areas protected for backpackers or wilderness areas for canoe campers.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the automobile, it very much facilitated the number of campers but, in reaction to that, the automobile also ended up creating places for backpacking and canoe camping too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: The automobile, one of the things it did as well, is it pretty much created the infrastructure of camping that we see today. Like, you go to any campsite, whether it’s a state park or national park, you’re going to see pretty much the same thing. You’re going to see a restroom facility. You’re going to see a table, like a cement table, or wooden picnic table with a grill, preset campsites. You’ll see showers and you’ll see the ubiquitous one way road that goes through. This started in about 1930s, right? With EP Meinecke, is that his last name? Tell us a little bit about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: Just before the 1930s, as we said, camping is booming because of the automobile and lots and lots of campers are coming, especially to the national parks and forests in the west. There’s no regulation. The national park service has an approach to regulation, which they refer to as indirect. That is, they don’t like to put up signs. They don’t like to tell you, “You can’t park here. You can’t do this there. You can’t do …”\n",
      "\n",
      "They’d rather put a rock in your way to get you to not park there or something like that. Well, they didn’t want to tell campers, “Don’t camp in places.” So people could camp virtually anywhere in the national park and they did. The problem was, they particularly liked to all camp in the same places, which would be like Stone Men Meadow at Yosemite or something. They liked to be right up against the rivers and this was killing the vegetation, polluting the rivers. Something had to be done about all of this as a result. Then, there’s all these cars crammed together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The forest service approached a gentleman named EP Minecky who worked for the department of agriculture. He was a plant pathologist. And they said, “Can you help?” He’d helped them with other vegetation issues and they said, “Look, the campers are basically killing the redwoods. The giant Sequoia as Sequoia National Park and the around the area. Can you help us?” Minecky went, took a look and said, “Yep, you’re right. All these campers in these cars, they’re killing the trees because they’re running over the roots.” So, they said, “What can we do?” Long story short, Minecky basically developed a design, the modern camp ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is, like you were saying, you now have fixed roads. They’re one way. Can’t go in both directions. You have a camping spur for your car. It’s sort of a garage in the forest if you will. There’s a table sitting there. There’s a place where your tent is supposed to go. There’s supposed to be, should be, some vegetation around you.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, sort of what he did was he created a space that mimicked a domestic space, which you had to fill up. Then, there were restrooms that you had to walk to nearby and water fountains, or whatever, spigot. Things like that nearby. This is all Minecky and he did this, basically, in 1932 is when he came up with this design, which as you said, is now just everywhere. Virtually every state national park I’ve ever been to basically uses this same design for their automobile campgrounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Minecky is the fellow who put that together and one of the peels to this, for the forest service and the park service, was not just that it eliminated pollution and that sort of thing, but also was, the parks were being over run by people. They were being loved to death by campers and the forest but, the administrations didn’t have anyway to sort of manage that. This camp ground gave them a tool. That is, what it did was, as they say it, unitized the campsites. That is, there’s a campsite number one, and when all campsites, all your 38 campsites or 107 or whatever there were, when somebody was in everyone then the authorities could say, “Camp ground’s full. You can’t camp here.” And previously they’d not been able to say it was full. People would just say, “I can cram something in there. I could shove a car in there. It’ll be fine.” This gave them an ability to control the campers so that they could make space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, they added the two week rule, or 30 day. Initially a 30 day rule, then a two week rule. You can only stay for 30 days or you can only stay for two weeks and then, you have to leave so somebody else can come in and camp here. It gave the authorities not only better protection of the environment but, it also gave them more control over camp grounds so that people would just come, which they did, and come and camp for three months and basically use up all the space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: Yeah. So, the car democratized camping even more but then, as you talk about in the book, there was sort of a revolt against car camping and this sort of emphasis on canoe camping but also backpacking. But one of the other movements that was going on in America that coincided with this shift was The Long Trail Movement, that started with the Appalachian Trail, then the Pacific Crest Trails. How did the Long Trail Movement sort of put the gas on backpacking in America?\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: People had been hiking, particularly in the northeast and the Appalachians. The Appalachian Mountain Club is an old organization, which had been about hiking. They had cabins and stuff like this along, they still do, along their trails. But in the early 20th century, 1910s, actually the first long distance trail is called the Long Trail in Vermont and this was supported by people who wanted to go out and camp as well as hike and just walk along so they’d have a place to do that. Backpackers, these things are all coming together. Backpackers had become more enthusiastic and they were more active and their equipment, their gear, was getting lighter in the early 20th century and they wanted places for themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, they pushed to create these long trails and as you said, probably the best known of the early ones is the Appalachian Trail, the AT, stretching, whatever it is, 2,000 miles. Then, it was followed, pretty quickly at least, by the idea of – took a little longer to complete – The Pacific Crest Trail. I think that the significance of these trails and the significance of backpacking in popular imagination has always remained strong, in that, this is form of camping, which even those people who don’t want to practice it, I think would admit that, “Yeah, there’s … It’s a special form and provides a special experience because you have to walk, just like people have always had to until 20th century, or whatever.” They finally got cars but people for 10,000 years have had to walk if they wanted to get places. That’s what backpackers do and it has this special appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we can see that popular significance, even today, in the consequence of Sheryl Straid’s book ‘Wild’, then the movie being made from it. This idea, Sheryl Straid, she went on the Pacific Crest Trail to find herself in that long walk and I’ve heard this from many people who have done seriously long distance backpacking, which I admit, I have not. But, I talked to one gentleman. He walked the AT three times, the entire thing and the last time he did it, at the end he broke down and just started crying and he couldn’t stop because he said doing that kind of long distance walking puts you in a mental state that’s simply not reproducible else where. There’s special places.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: I’m curious, I forgot to ask this Terence but, was this whole camping craze, beginning in the 19th century into the middle part of the 20th century, was this a uniquely American thing or were other western countries also experience this sort of camping craze going on?\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: Well, camping is equally popular in Canada, to Americans. It’s more or less contemporary with what’s happening in the United States. I don’t think it’s quite as intense. The forms are practiced elsewhere but the meaning, I think, is really an American Experience. I mean, you can go to France. French are big campers. Or Germany or Sweden, or any of number of places around the world, Australia and stuff. And you’ll find people who are camping but the reason they camp is, like in the case of Europeans in particular, it’s an inexpensive form of vacation. They’ll tell you that. “Why you camping?” “Well, it’s cheap and allows us to be here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, I think to say that about American camping, just see it as something that’s inexpensive vacation, misses the cultural significance that it has held for us for a long time. It’s a means for Americans who aren’t comfortable with cities to kind of make up for having to live in them. I mean, we understand if you want to have a job and good income and all that today, you’re going to more or less end up living in a city. But, you don’t have to like it. Camping is a way to kind of make up for it for a couple of weeks, or whatever. That is unusual. That’s something Americans do. More than anybody else.\n",
      "\n",
      "You’d have to ask … If you go to Britain, “Why do they camp?” They have other reasons but not the same as us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: What’s the state of American camping today?\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: It’s still very strong. Latest surveys I’ve read put camping, we’re talking at least, a minimum of 50 million Americans, about 1/6 of the population go camping every year. When you ask people, “What do you do in your leisure time?” You give them a list of things and they’ll pick them. Camping almost invariably ends up in the top 10 and that’s up there with watching television, and going to restaurants and stuff like this. It remains extremely popular in America.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, I would say it is not as significant … Well, the numbers are still enormous. It’s not as culturally significant as it once was. I think the kind of high point in American history for camping, as a kind of cultural phenomenon, was the 1920s. It was that car. I mean, the car liberated people to go camping. Everybody went camping. Henry Ford, John Burrows, Harvey Firestone and Thomas Edison had these annual camping trips that they did and that were in the news and stuff like this. President Harding joined them on a camping trip. It was enormous at that time. But the total number, of course, is much smaller than now.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other thing I would say about camping today is I suspect in part, it’s slowly declining. Not seriously and certainly in backpacking hasn’t declined but, the other forms of camping, the number of people doing them, seems to be in a slow decline but not serious. I would like to think, I mean I’m not sure exactly why, but I would like to think that one of the reasons is that American cities are becoming more comfortable little … There’s a little bit more wildness in American cities and the need to leave the city, to go into some place far away, isn’t quite as necessary anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "I say this in part because if you look at pictures of American cities in 1920, they are just so bare. Those street trees and are few and just little green anywhere. You compare that now to the efforts that I think we’re trying to do now a days to green up our cities, put in more squares, put in more street trees, just generally make them more comfortable in terms of mix of wild and art, human art. It’s perhaps taken a little bit of the sting out of life in the city and therefore, a little less desire to go camping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: Well, Terence this has been a great conversation. There’s a lot more we could talk about in the book but where can people go to learn more information about the book?\n",
      "\n",
      "Terence Young: Well, I have a Facebook page for the book, as a matter of fact, called Heading Out or Camping in America, I think either one will take you there. But also, the book is published by Cornell University Press and they have a website, CornellPress.Cornell.edu and you can find out everything about it there and it’s for sale in book stores, online, that sort of thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brett McKay: Fantastic. Well, Terence Young thank you so much for your time. It’s been a pleasure.\n",
      "\n",

      "I’ve seen a statistic thrown around on the internet that 95% of adults over the age of 30 will never sprint again for the rest of their lives. \n",
      "\n",
      "While these numbers are probably made up, they do capture something that I’ve noticed anecdotally: there aren’t many adults out there sprinting. Heck, if I look at my own life during the past decade, I haven’t done much all-out sprinting myself. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, I’ve done HIIT work on an assault bike, burpees, and bodyweight exercises to get my heart rate up for conditioning, but bouts of running as fast as I can have been few and far between. I’ve sprinted in some ultimate frisbee games or while playing flag football with the boys I coach, but that’s about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last time I did wind sprints as part of a workout was way back in 2016. It had been the first time in years I had run full speed for more than 40 yards. The result? I gave myself terrible tendonitis in my right hamstring that prevented me from squatting and deadlifting for about a month and made sitting down rather uncomfortable. It still bothers me now, seven years later. \n",
      "\n",
      "After reading that statistic about how few adults sprint after age 30, I felt inspired to figure out a way to take up sprinting again without injuring myself. I want to be an old codger who can still sprint at full speed at age 75 (even if full speed at age 75 will be as fast as my slow jog is now). \n",
      "\n",
      "Why? \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I do enjoy playing sports that require sprinting. Ultimate frisbee, flag football, and basketball are some games I play where you sprint. I want to be able to continue to play these games with my kids and even my grandkids. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, sprinting is one of those physical skills that could save my life one day. I want to be able to run as fast as possible when my life depends on it without worrying I’ll blow my knees out. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, sprinting is a great workout. You can do it anywhere, and it’s great for anaerobic conditioning. Sprinting can also strengthen lower leg muscles and tendons, enhancing your durability. \n",
      "\n",
      "To help me get back into sprinting without injuring myself, I talked to Matt Tometz, Assistant Director of Olympic Sports Performance at Northwestern University. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s your guide to sprinting as a grown-up. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you’ve tried sprinting as an adult after a long hiatus away from it, you may have experienced an injury like I did. While you might think it’s due primarily to age, injuries from sprinting occur frequently, even among elite athletes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sprinting is a high-impact, high-strain activity. You’re contracting your leg muscles repeatedly with a lot of force during the sprint. If the muscles and tendons in your legs haven’t been strengthened to handle those forceful, repeated contractions, you’re setting yourself up for a muscle strain or tendon injury. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Think of a sprint as a one-rep max on a deadlift,” Matt told me. “You wouldn’t try deadlifting 405 pounds unless you progressively trained your way to lift that much. You’d just injure yourself if you tried deadlifting 405 pounds without training. The same thing goes with sprinting.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So, how do we prep our bodies for full-on sprints? \n",
      "\n",
      "Matt recommends doing a warm-up before your workout that includes both plyometrics and reduced-intensity sprints:\n",
      "\n",
      "Plyometrics. Matt likes to have his athletes do ankle jumps as part of their warm-up. “Jumping and doing plyos can help strengthen and prepare your hamstring muscles and tendons to deal with the extreme force and tension that’s going to occur when you sprint,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matt recommends doing the following plyo exercise: Stand in place with your feet shoulder-width apart. Keeping your knees straight, jump off the ground. As your feet come off the ground, flex your ankles and pull your toes up as high as possible. Extend your ankles shortly before you come back to the floor and push the balls of your feet into the ground explosively. Jump again immediately. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Do ten reps for a set of two. The goal is to be bouncy and explosive,” Matt said. \n",
      "\n",
      "Besides ankle jumps, other plyometric exercises you could do to prepare for sprinting include power skipping, alternate leg bounding, and lateral jumps. Do two sets of each exercise. Keep things bouncy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Reduced-intensity sprints. Before any sprint session, you should not only do plyos but some warm-up sprints as well. The intensity of your warm-up sprints should be around 15% less than the sprints you’ll be doing in your main workout. So if you’ll be doing the sprints in your main workout at 95% intensity, you’ll want to do your warm-up sprints at about 80% intensity. \n",
      "\n",
      "Do 2-3 warm-up sprints at that 15%-less effort. The goal with warm-up sprints is to practice the movement of sprinting.\n",
      "\n",
      "For individuals who haven’t sprinted in a long time, Matt recommends starting with longer distances but keeping the intensity low. Week by week, you’ll shorten the distance and ramp up the intensity. \n",
      "\n",
      "For each week’s workout, start with 2-3 lower-intensity warm-up sprints and two 10-rep sets of plyos. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then perform 3-4 sprints, at the following distances, with 2 minutes of rest between them:\n",
      "\n",
      "Bam. You’ve worked your way up to a full sprint without injuring yourself. \n",
      "\n",
      "After this on-ramping sequence, Matt recommends slowly adding distance to your sprint workouts while maintaining high intensity. \n",
      "\n",
      "For each week’s workout, start with 2-3 warm-up sprints at ~80% intensity and two 10-rep sets of plyos. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then perform 3-4 sprints at 95-97% intensity with 2 minutes of rest between them:\n",
      "\n",
      "You shouldn’t feel destroyed after every sprint session; you should feel like you’ve left some in the tank when you’re done.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you can see, this program takes time to add distance. Slow and steady is the key if you want to add sprinting into your workout routine without getting injured. \n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a lot we could get into in terms of proper technique for sprinting, but for the average dude, Matt’s biggest recommendation is to keep things loose and easy when you’re sprinting: “A lot of people think they need to be really tight and have their neck muscles all strained while they’re sprinting. But if you look at elite athletes, they look really relaxed when they’re sprinting. Do the same. Focus on staying relaxed, and it will help keep your form fluid and smooth, which will help with speed and reduce your chances of injuring yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As a help in staying relaxed, one of the greatest sprinting coaches of all time, Bud Winter, would impress upon his athletes two big cues: “loose jaw — loose hands.” Winter thought that relaxing your hands and jaw (even the lips and tongue) “tends to keep your entire body relaxed.” So try to sprint with what he called the “brook trout look.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Sprinting can be incorporated into your strength-training workouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matt likes to consolidate stress in his athletes so they have plenty of time to recover. Since sprinting will primarily stress your lower body, you’ll want to do them on the days you do your lower-body strength training to consolidate your lower-body stress in a single workout. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since Matt’s focus is on helping his athletes get faster, he likes to have them do their sprint work before strength training. “I want my athletes to sprint when they’re feeling the freshest. Also, the sprints can help an athlete feel good and loose before hitting the weights,” he told me.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as we discussed in our article about whether you should do cardio before weights in a workout or vice versa, doing cardio first does fatigue the muscles, decreasing the amount of contractual force you’ll be able to call upon while lifting. So, if strength training is your primary goal, then consider doing your sprints after your lifting session.\n",
      "\n",
      "I reckon for most dudes just trying to stay strong and get some sprinting in, it probably doesn’t matter much in the long run whether you sprint or lift first. Do what you prefer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experiencing the satisfaction of moving your body as fast as it can truck under its own power isn’t something that should end in your twenties. Keep feeling after your limits and stay in touch with that explosive “Go!” at every age.\n"
